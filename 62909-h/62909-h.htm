<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br /><span class="h_subtitle">ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF UNIFORM</span></h2></div>

<p>In its military sense the word “uniform,” as a noun, is specifically
used to denote the distinctive style of dress and equipment established
by governmental regulation and worn by any naval or military
organization in order that all of the individual elements of that
organization will present a homogeneous appearance. In general all
uniforms are divided into two principal classes, dress uniforms and
undress or service uniforms, the modern field uniforms belonging to the
latter class. Dress uniforms are for use on occasions of ceremony and,
as in the case of civilian attire, they are usually more ornate and
gaudy than the working service uniforms.</p>

<p>The use of some form of uniform dress for fighting men both on land
and sea is common to all civilized nations and this general custom has
resulted from a gradual growth during the whole Christian era. In this
growth military necessity, convenience, economical considerations and
sentiment have all played a part.</p>

<p>The famed Legions of Cæsar were by imperial order all garbed and armed
alike, which is one of the first recorded cases of the use of a uniform
for soldiers. Some of the regiments of Hannibal also wore distinctive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
colors practically amounting to a uniform. The galley slaves of ancient
Rome, the “motive power” of the man-of-war of that day, were all garbed
in a costume of identical cut and color bearing the number of the
galley in which they served, but this should be looked upon more as a
badge of servitude than as a naval uniform.</p>

<p>As time went by the leaders in command of the land forces perceived
the necessity for some mark or badge to designate the members of their
forces and to distinguish them from the foe. This resulted in the use
of various distinctive badges, such as plumes of a certain color to be
worn upon the helmet, initials, numbers or devices in the nature of a
coat of arms to be worn upon the front of the helmet, on the breast
plate of armor, on the tops of the shoulders or upon the shield, a
custom which still prevails in the armies of to-day.</p>

<p>When Gustavus Adolphus, “the Whirlwind of the North,” swept down over
Europe with his victorious army of Sweden, he marked the brigades of
his army with sashes worn diagonally across the body from one shoulder,
a distinctive color for each brigade, and as a result history records
the valorous deeds of the “Red Brigade” or the “Green Brigade” of that
wonderful army. This species of uniform survives in the General’s sash
for the dress uniforms of the present time.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century the King of France by royal decree
established a uniform dress for his army and regulations were issued
prescribing the color and style of the various articles of dress for
officers and men and the occasions on which they were to be worn. At
that time in England various princes and lords had armed forces of
retainers and each such force was dressed and armed according to the
individual taste of its overlord.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Great Rebellion in England resulted in the establishment of
the Commonwealth under Cromwell as Protector in 1653, the New Model
army was established as a national force and, while this force was
clothed in the style of the day, distinctive colors were ordered so
that the whole force was uniform in appearance. The hat of the period
was the high crowned, wide brimmed felt “slouch” hat, and in its
various shapes this head dress has been retained down to the present.
First its brim was pinned up on one side by a rosette of the colors of
the government of the date, then to add to its jauntiness it was pinned
up in three places resulting in the three-cornered “cocked hat” of the
American Revolutionary period, and to-day we see it again almost in its
original form in the modern “field hat” of the United States Army and
Marine Corps, a head dress which is also worn by the British Colonial
troops from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p>

<p>The wide brimmed hat was not suitable for wear at sea as it “carried
too much sail in a gale,” and the naval officers fastened it up against
the crown on both sides and crushed the crown together in a “fore and
aft” line. In this form the erstwhile “slouch hat” now appears as the
chapeau or cocked hat worn with dress uniforms by the officers of all
modern navies and by the general officers of the United States Army
with full dress uniform.</p>

<p>Cords of various colors were worn around the base of the crown of the
“slouch hat” when it was first adopted, and for ornamentation these
cords had tassels at the ends, while the different colors of the hat
cords indicated the regiment, corps or service of the wearer. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
cords in various colors, depending upon the service or corps of the
wearer, are now worn on the field hats of officers and men in the
United States Army and Marine Corps, as described later in this book,
and the tradition of the hat cord tassels is still kept in the cocked
hat of the naval officer by the gold bullion tassels at the front and
rear peaks. Likewise the influence of the original loop strap and
button for fastening up the brim of the original “slouch hat” is seen
in the United States naval officer’s cocked hat in the shape of the
gold lace strap and gilt button on the side of the crown.</p>

<p>When the Restoration in England brought Charles II to the throne in
1660 a royal army was organized in England, this action being due to
the fact that the success of the revolutionists under Cromwell had
proved the unreliability of the previous system. The standard colors
chosen by the king for his soldiers were red and blue, the colors
of the royal livery, and these colors survive to-day in the British
infantry full dress uniforms of red with blue facings.</p>

<p>As time went by various regiments of foot and horse were raised, the
men from any given regiment coming as a rule from one locality or
county. The officers of these troops were practically all drawn from
the nobility and upper classes, and it became common for the colonelcy
to be conferred upon the head of the local noble house. These colonels
chose many slight variations in uniform for their men in accordance
with their tastes in dress and style, in deference to some local habits
of dress or as might be limited by the length of their purse.</p>

<p>These regiments came to be known by the name of the county or city from
which they were recruited; a custom which still prevails in the British
service, and which to a great extent has been followed in the army of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the United States, especially with the volunteers of our former wars.</p>

<p>In England this brought about a condition as to uniform that was
apparently directly the opposite of uniform, as each territorial
regiment had its own distinctive dress and decorations. Gradually,
however, with the consolidation of all of the armed forces of the
United Kingdom into one national army, the regulars forming the first
line and the militia or “Territorials” forming the second line, or
reserve, a universal service uniform was adopted for active service and
came to be known as a “field” uniform. The older distinctive colors and
styles of regimental uniforms were preserved in the full dress uniforms
and reserved for peace time parade.</p>

<p>As a result of the use of heraldic devices for badges of the different
regiments and corps under the old territorial system, each regiment
has its own coat of arms, and in the later national army of Great
Britain these were retained as “regimental badges.” These badges bear
the coat of arms of some great colonel of the regiment, the name and
date of some famous victory in which the regiment won renown, or some
distinctive device appropriate to the county or colony from which the
men of the regiment are recruited.</p>

<p>Such regimental badges, founded largely upon sentiment but still
appealing mightily to the imagination of the young recruit that joins
the colors with the high heart of youth, are a great aid to discipline
and efficiency, since discipline means the implicit obedience on the
part of every one in the service to the orders from higher authority in
such a manner as to secure the greatest cohesion and coordination and
hence the greatest effect. These little metal badges bearing the symbols
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and mottoes that bring daily to the minds of their wearers the valorous
deeds that their regiment has done in the past arouse the spirit of
emulation and competition, the desire to fight as well or better than
the old regiment fought on some other bloody field perhaps a century
ago, and help to create <i>esprit de corps</i>—the soul of an army.</p>

<p>In the United States services there are also distinctive regimental and
corps devices which, while indicating the branch and corps to which the
wearer belongs, also keep alive the glorious traditions of the past wars.</p>

<p>As France was the first country of modern times to establish by
governmental regulation and order a uniform dress for her armed forces
on shore, so has she been the most consistent of all countries in
dressing all branches of her service on much the same color scheme,
though here as in the other countries is sometimes seen the influence
of the native dress of the lands into which the French have extended
their colonial activities.</p>

<p>Until quite recently the common uniform of the French army consisted
of red trousers or breeches, blue coats and red caps. From the Barbary
coast of North Africa and especially the French colony of Algeria the
French colonial troops derived the style of dress known as “Zouave”
uniform, with baggy trousers, short braid decorated jacket and
tasselled turban. But even in these uniforms the general color scheme
of red trousers and blue coat with red head dress was carried out.</p>

<p>In the United States the influence of the Zouave uniform can be traced
to the same style of dress used by certain regiments of our great Civil
War of 1860-65. Notable among these regiments were the “Louisiana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Tigers” of the Confederate Army and the “Zouave Division” of the Union Army.</p>

<p>In the uniforms of Germany the influence of the many individual states
and principalities which went to form the greater Germany of to-day
is seen in the colors and styles of the various regiments. The dress
uniforms of the German Army still retain some of the distinctive
colors of the original armies of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Wurttemburg
and Brandenburg, but for field service in war the whole army has a
uniform of dull gray color, the various territorial distinctions being
indicated by colored stripes and straps only.</p>

<p>The Italian troops have a number of distinctive uniforms for different
corps and services, but the universal full dress coat is of a dark
blue shade, the color of the trousers varying with the corps, and the
different colors are used as cuffs and facings to distinguish different
branches. Their field uniform is almost universally of a gray shade,
though the influence of the prevailing background upon the color of
uniform is seen in the white uniforms worn by the troops that must
fight in the snow covered mountains of the northern frontier, and the
use of khaki is becoming more common.</p>

<p>In Austria-Hungary the effect of the many different peoples that go
to make up that empire has resulted in a great variety of colors and
styles for uniforms, almost every color and shade being shown in the
dress uniforms of the different corps. But for the field uniforms
necessity has again ruled and dull shades of gray and green predominate.</p>

<p>Up to 1866 the Austrian regiments wore a great deal of white in their
uniforms, while the picturesque dress of the Hungarian civil population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was reflected in the gaudy uniforms of the Hussars, a style copied into
all of the cavalry troops of Europe to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

<p>In Russia there is a great variety in full dress uniforms, and the
effect of the long coat and turban of the Cossack on one hand and
the bright plumes and short jackets of the Central European cavalry
on the other is traceable. For field service uniforms dull shades of
gray-green have become almost universal, and the cold of the long
winters has naturally resulted in the use of long and heavy overcoats.
The Russian soldiers all wear top boots instead of the low topped
laced shoes common for foot troops in the armies of France, England
and America. In this respect the Germans follow the same custom as the
Russians.</p>

<p>The uniforms of the United States Army and Marine Corps have resulted
from an adoption of the styles of the older nations with such
modifications as were from time to time dictated by local conditions
or national sentiment. Before the Revolution of 1776 the colonial
troops naturally followed the example of the British expeditionary
troops serving in the Thirteen Colonies, with modifications to suit
the climate and the nature of the country occupied. During the War of
the Revolution the effect of the alliance with France was seen in the
adoption of certain features of the French uniform, and the service
of the Prussian generals Von Steuben and De Kalb also resulted in the
adoption of certain features of the Prussian armies of that date.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the United States Government the wars with
the Indians caused changes in the uniform of some of the troops by the
adoption of some of the articles of the frontiersman’s dress, such as
deer-skin jackets, coonskin caps and powder horns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The original idea of the founders of the country was to have every
able-bodied man receive some training as a soldier, and from this
came the militia of early days and the volunteers that fought the War
of 1812. The militia of the different States and territories were
uniformed largely by each State or territory designating its own style
of military dress copied from the different armies abroad and with
trimmings and colors to distinguish the different arms of the service.</p>

<p>The establishment of a small regular army after the War of 1812 brought
with it a government regulation uniform for regular troops, which
was in turn followed to some extent by the state troops or militia,
but there were still many different styles of uniform in use through
the Mexican War and up to the breaking out of the Civil War in 1860.
Different units of the forces came to be known by the colors of their
uniforms, such as the “Richmond Blues,” the “Red Zouaves,” the “Blue
Zouaves,” the “Grays,” and many crack regiments of the militia, or as
it came to be known later, the National Guard of the different States,
had their own distinctive color and cut of uniform dress.</p>

<p>The great Civil War called such large bodies of men to the colors of
the two contending sides that the question of economy demanded that the
service uniforms for each side be made of one standard color and style,
the armies of the North wearing blue and those of the South wearing
gray. In each army, however, the different corps were distinguished
by a distinctive color for the trimmings or “facings,” a custom which
still prevails for the dress uniforms of our troops.</p>

<p>After the war with Spain in 1898 steps were taken to bring the uniforms
of the several State National Guards into general conformity with that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the Regular Army, and, with the granting of national financial aid
to these state troops and the issue to them of government regulation
clothing and equipment, all of the armed forces of the country,
regular, state and volunteer, gradually came to wear the same uniform,
the different kinds of troops being distinguished by the design of the
buttons or by letters worn on the collars.</p>

<p>In one feature the United States troops of to-day, both in the Army and
the Marine Corps, still retain a relic of the “stock” of former times;
this is the close fitting, standing collar of the coats for both full
dress and service uniforms. The original idea of the stock was to make
the soldier hold his head up and stand stiffly erect, and it dates from
the time when Frederick the Great introduced mathematical precision
into every motion of drill and maneuver.</p>

<p>In the early days when the marines wore a leather stock the sailor in
his wide collared shirt dubbed the marine a “leatherneck,” a term still
applied to him in the slang phrase of the service.</p>

<p>Military necessity has often dictated the color of the clothing worn by
troops in the field. An early example of this was the adoption in 1755
of a dark green uniform by the British Royal American Regiment while
fighting against the French and Indians in the forest covered country
in the northwest of the original American colonies. The North American
Indian was an adept at “bush-whacking” and concealment in the forest,
and to meet him on anything like an equal footing it was necessary
for the British and colonial troops to wear a color suited to the
prevailing background. In later years this regiment’s name was changed
to “King’s Royal Rifles” and as an heirloom of its first service the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
rifle regiments of the British Army still wear green coats for their
full dress uniform.</p>

<p>In the days when smooth-bore muskets were the arms of infantry,
the range of such weapons was very short and the opposing battle
lines approached each other so closely that the figures of the men
were plainly visible whatever the color of their clothing might be.
Histories of the wars of a century ago tell of the colonels’ commands
to “wait till you see the whites of their eyes before you fire” and
“hold your fire until you can count their coat buttons.”</p>

<p>Under such circumstances striking and distinctive uniforms of gaudy
colors bedecked with gold and silver braid and bright buttons were no
detriment, but with the great increase in the range and accuracy of
modern rifles it has become necessary to render the men on the battle
line as inconspicuous as possible, and, as a result, in all of the
great armies of the world dull colored uniforms of neutral shade have
replaced the brilliant reds, blues, yellows and greens of former times,
and brass buttons have given way to buttons of bronze, leather or iron,
the bright hued uniforms with their corresponding brass buttons and
braid being kept for full dress and peace time parade.</p>

<p>In the United States Army and Marine Corps the prevalent color for
the field service uniforms is some shade of the dull brown commonly
known as “khaki,” and the bright gilt and silver buttons, corps and
regimental devices and numbers and belt buckles have been replaced to a
great extent by dull bronze buttons and ornaments, insignia of rank for
officers only being still made of silver and gold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Khaki” (pronounced <i>kar-key</i>, with the accent on the second syllable)
is an East Indian word meaning “dust color” or “earth color.” In the
dry season in India the fields and vegetation turn brown and the roads
are heavy with dust which, carried by the winds, soon covers the
foliage of trees and shrubbery, so that the whole landscape presents a
somber aspect in one brown, dust-colored hue.</p>

<p>In the earlier days of the British occupation of India the British
and loyal Indian troops wore white cotton or duck uniforms in the hot
weather of the dry season, but these stood out so plainly against
the prevailing dust color of the roads and surrounding country as to
make their wearers distinct targets for the bush-whacking snipers of
the enemy tribesmen. Learning from bitter experience the necessity
for making themselves less conspicuous, the soldiers dipped their
uniforms in muddy pools and streams to give them the same color as the
background against which they must appear.</p>

<p>This expedient showed good results in reducing the casualty lists, and
dust-colored or “khaki” uniforms gradually replaced the white uniforms
with bright colored trimmings for summer service, and later for the
same reasons the same or a similar color was also adopted for the
winter field or “fighting” uniforms of the British Army.</p>

<p>Grim necessity gradually overcame the natural conservatism of the
military mind and the sentimental traditions that hung around the
colors of the uniforms that the troops had worn in famous campaigns,
until all of the great nations have now adopted “khaki” or other
dull colored uniforms for their troops in the field. This has taken
away from the battlefield much of its former picturesqueness and pomp;
gone from the battlefield is the “thin red line” of English poetry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
song, the red and blue of the French infantry, the gray and white of
the Austrians, and the blue, white and gold of the German Uhlans, while
the “American Boys in Blue” no longer charge with bayonets glittering
in the sun beneath the Stars and Stripes. To paraphrase a well-known
quotation, “It is not magnificent but it is war.”</p>

<p>In the naval services of the world the adoption of a regulation uniform
dress for officers and enlisted men came at a much later date than in
the armies, although the marines, being essentially “sea soldiers,”
followed the uniform regulations of the shore forces to a great extent
and were put in uniform much earlier than the sailors of the ships’ crews.</p>

<p>In the British Navy of Nelson’s time the officers wore uniforms
following certain prescribed styles, and the rank of the officer was
marked by insignia upon the epaulets and by sleeve and cuff decorations
as well, but the sailors who set and worked the sails and manned the
guns had no prescribed dress. It was the custom of those days for each
commodore and captain to prescribe a uniform dress for the crew of his
“barge” or “gig” (the “barge” being the special small boat propelled
by oars in which the admiral or commodore went from ship to shore and
<i>vice versa</i>, and the “gig” being the name for a similar boat used
especially by the captain of the ship).</p>

<p>These uniforms for the special boats’ crews were often fanciful in
design and gay in color schemes and served to enliven the landing
places at many a busy port.</p>

<p>During the Revolution the ships of the American Navy consisted at first
of merchantmen armed with a few guns and manned by the hardy seamen of
the merchant marine of the colonies. Later men-of-war were especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
built for that service and manned by duly commissioned officers and men
enlisted into the government service, but the British Navy was so large
that the colonials could make no headway against its strong fleets,
and a cruising and raiding warfare was resorted to for the purpose of
destroying as much British merchant shipping as possible. This warfare
was carried on principally by privateers, merchantmen armed and heavily
manned for the purpose and in some cases fast ships especially built
for such service. These privateers were officered by the splendid sea
captains of that date who were granted “letters of marque” by the
Colonial Government to carry the flag and prey upon the commerce of
the enemy, dividing the profits derived from the captured cargoes in
fixed proportion between the owners and crew of the privateers and the
Government.</p>

<p>Under such conditions there was no fixed uniform, and though the
officers frequently provided themselves with a dress patterned after
that of the French Navy with which they were allied, the men wore any
kind of clothing suited to their fancy.</p>

<p>After the Revolution the standing or regular army went out of
existence, but it soon became necessary to establish a regular navy
which consisted of a few fast, heavily gunned sailing frigates of the
type of the <i>Constitution</i>, <i>Constellation</i> and <i>Chesapeake</i>.
When the War of 1812 came on it was this small but remarkably efficient regular
navy that alone saved the United States from disaster and dishonor.</p>

<p>By 1812 a regulation uniform had been prescribed for the officers of
the Navy, but the men were still allowed to wear any kind of clothing
suited to their work. Long cruises in distant seas made it necessary,
however, for a supply of clothing for the members of the crew to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
carried by the purser (the paymaster of that day), and as a measure of
economy and convenience these clothes were all made in the same style,
a custom which gradually brought about a certain uniformity in the garb
of the enlisted personnel of the Navy.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the accepted sailor uniform consisted of easy
fitting garments suited to the work of hauling on the ropes, working
aloft on the rigging, masts and spars of the sailing ships and pulling
at the oars of the small boats. From this beginning came the sailor
uniform of to-day, the bell-mouthed trousers that could be rolled up
quickly and easily when the barefooted sailors washed down the decks,
the easy-fitting, loose-necked shirt or “jumper,” the short overcoat
or “peacoat” for winter wear, and the loose-topped, brimless cap which
to give it a smarter appearance when going ashore “on liberty” (the
sailor term for leave of absence) was provided with a light ring or
“grommet” to stretch the crown out flat, resulting in the common sailor
“flat-hat” of to-day.</p>

<p>This sailor uniform was originally designed for wear aboard ships
driven by sail-power, and though it is not especially suited to
the great steam-driven dreadnaughts of the modern navy it is still
retained, partly on account of sentiment and tradition and partly on
account of the fact that the Navy is probably more conservative than
any other profession or calling.</p>

<p>The uniforms of both officers and enlisted men in the United States
Navy follow rather closely in style, color and cut those worn in the
British Navy, and some interesting traditions of the latter service may
be seen even in our naval service. For instance, the black neckerchief
worn alike by the British and American sailor was made black after
Trafalgar as an emblem of mourning for the Great Nelson, and the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
white stripes around the edges of the collar were so placed to commemorate
Nelson’s three great victories, Copenhagen, the Nile and Trafalgar.</p>

<p>In all countries naval uniforms follow much the same patterns and
practically all are of the same colors; dark blue, the so-called “navy
blue,” for winter wear, and white for summer wear.</p>

<p>The need of an inconspicuous uniform for naval officers and men is
not so apparent as it is in the case of the land forces, since in the
battles of ships at sea it is the ship which is the target and not the
personnel as in the battles on land.</p>

<p>Thus we see how tradition, sentiment and military necessity have each
played a part in the development of the uniforms worn by the fighting
forces of our country on land and sea.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br /><span class="h_subtitle">SERVICE, CORPS AND RANK</span></h2></div>

<p>The armed forces of the United States of America provided by
the statute law of the land pursuant to the provisions of the
Constitution are embraced within two grand divisions, the land forces
and the sea forces, under the supreme command of the President as
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>These two grand divisions are subdivided into various services
according to the duties required of them and the laws establishing and
maintaining them.</p>

<p><i>The Land Forces.</i>—The land forces of the United States are made up
of the regular army or as it is sometimes called the “standing army,”
the organized land militia when called into the service of the United
States which is practically the same as the so-called national guards
of the several states, and such volunteers and drafted men as may be
authorized by the Congress from time to time as occasion demands.</p>

<p>In times of peace the Army consists of the regular army, but in case
of an invasion or threatened invasion of the territory of the United
States or of rebellion or threatened war against the constituted
government of the nation, this force may be augmented by calling the
organized militia into service and further augmented if necessary by
the employment of volunteers or drafted men, with the authorization of
the Congress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The land forces, however raised, are also divided into the Mobile
Army and the Coast Artillery. The mobile army is intended for active
offensive operations against the enemy and is so called on account
of the fact that for its duties it requires the greatest degree of
mobility possible, while the coast artillery is intended to man and
fight the fixed and movable elements of land and coast fortifications
including land mines, submarine mines and torpedo defenses pertaining
to the fortifications.</p>

<p>These two groups frequently assist each other, the mobile forces
protecting the flanks and approaches to the fixed defenses, and the
latter being used as turning points or supporting points to the lines
of the mobile forces.</p>

<p>The Army is divided into various arms or corps according to the duties
required, as follows: infantry, cavalry, field artillery, coast
artillery corps, engineer corps, signal corps including aviation
section, quartermaster corps, ordnance corps, judge advocate’s corps,
inspector general’s corps and medical corps. Each of these arms
or corps has a distinctive badge to be worn on all uniforms and a
distinctive color for the facings and trimmings of dress uniforms, as
described and illustrated in <a href="#Page_64">Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<p>For purposes of administration and control under war conditions the
mobile land forces are organized into Field Armies, the basis of the
organization being the Division. The division as prescribed in the
United States Army is an organization containing all of the arms and
services necessary for independent action.</p>

<p>A field army may be divided into army corps, each such being composed
of two or more divisions.</p>

<p>Divisions are subdivided into brigades, which are in turn subdivided
into regiments. A regiment of infantry is usually composed of three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
battalions of four companies each; a regiment of cavalry of three
squadrons of four troops each; and a regiment of field artillery of two
battalions of three batteries each. Engineers are formed into regiments
according to the special requirements of their duties. The Coast
Artillery is organized into companies, the number of companies in any
one command depending upon the size of the forts to be garrisoned.</p>

<p>Signal Corps troops are organized into companies and larger
organizations according to the duties assigned to them.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster Corps is charged with providing the supplies required
and with the transportation of both men and supplies.</p>

<p>The Medical Corps has charge of the hospitals and the personnel
required by them both at the permanent stations and in the field, and
for this purpose the corps is organized into ambulance companies and
field hospitals.</p>

<p>Chaplains are assigned to regiments and other organizations as
may be required.</p>

<p>Veterinarians, who are commissioned officers, are assigned to the
cavalry, field artillery and quartermaster transport trains, and
also have charge of such veterinary hospitals as may be required at
permanent posts or in the field.</p>

<p>The command of the Army is exercised by the President as
Commander-in-Chief through the medium of the Secretary of War and the
Chief of Staff, the latter officer having the rank of General and
taking the place of the former Commanding General of the Army.</p>

<p>The General Staff Corps of the Army, consisting of commissioned
officers detailed from the various branches of the Army for a term of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
four years’ service, is charged with the duties of effecting under
the direction of the Chief of Staff the coordination and harmonious
cooperation of all branches of the military service, both line and
staff, in the execution of the military policies of the Government in
peace and war.</p>

<p>The administration of the Army and the War Department is effected under
the Secretary of War through the Chief of Staff by various bureaus or
offices, as follows: the Coast Artillery under a chief with the rank
of Major General; the Adjutant General’s Department under an Adjutant
General with the rank of Major General, which is the department of
records, orders and correspondence of the Army and the Militia; the
Judge Advocate General’s Department, under a Judge Advocate General
with the rank of Major General, which is the legal department of the
Army; the Inspector General’s Department under an Inspector General
with the rank of Major General; the Quartermaster Department, under a
Quartermaster General with the rank of Major General, which has charge
of supply and transportation; the Medical Department, under a Surgeon
General with the rank of Major General; the Corps of Engineers, under
a Chief of Engineers with the rank of Major General; the Ordnance
Corps, under a Chief of Ordnance with the rank of Major General; and
the Signal Corps, under a Chief Signal Officer with the rank of Major General.</p>

<p><i>The Sea Forces.</i>—The sea forces of the United States consist of
the regular Navy, the Marine Corps, the Naval Militia of the several
States and territories when mustered into the service of the United
States, and the Coast Guard and Lighthouse Service when transferred to
the jurisdiction of the Navy Department in time of war or when war is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
imminent, including in each case both the vessels and the personnel
pertaining to them, afloat and ashore. The vessels of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey and of the Bureau of Fisheries may also be transferred
to the jurisdiction of the Navy in time of war.</p>

<p>The vessels of the Navy are organized into fleets which are divided
for purposes of administration and tactics into forces, squadrons,
divisions, and sections.</p>

<p>A “Fleet” is an aggregation of vessels of various classes in one
organization under one command.</p>

<p>Fleets are subdivided into “Forces,” each “Force” being made up of the
vessels of a fleet that are of the same class or type that are assigned
to perform the same duty.</p>

<p>A “Force” is subdivided into “Squadrons,” and in turn, a “Squadron”
is subdivided into “Divisions,” and a “Division” is subdivided into
“Sections.”</p>

<p>A “Section” consists of two vessels of the larger classes or three
vessels of the smaller classes; a “Division” normally consists of two
“Sections,” and a “Squadron” usually consists of two “Divisions,”
although the numbers in each subdivision may be varied to suit special
occasions or duties.</p>

<p>A squadron of torpedo vessels is called a “Flotilla,” in deference to
long established custom.</p>

<p>A completely organized Fleet is composed of a Battleship Force, a Scout
Force, a Cruiser Force, a Destroyer Force, a Submarine Force, a Mine
Force and a Train Force, the latter consisting of the supply ships and
repair vessels and transports and being usually referred to as the “Train.”</p>

<p>The Navy is administered ashore by a bureau system, consisting of a
number of bureaus and offices having charge of the various activities
required for the building and upkeep of the fleets at sea, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
directed by the Secretary of the Navy through the Office of Naval
Operations, the Chief of Naval Operations with the rank of Admiral
being the senior or ranking officer of the Navy.</p>

<p>The bureaus are the Bureau of Navigation, whose Chief has the rank of
Rear Admiral, and which has charge of the issuing and enforcing of
orders to officers and enlisted men and the keeping of the records; the
Bureau of Ordnance, whose Chief has the rank of Rear Admiral, and which
has charge of the design, manufacture and repair of guns, torpedoes and
ammunition; the Bureau of Construction and Repair, whose head is the
Chief Constructor of the Navy and has the rank of Rear Admiral, and
which has charge of the designing, construction and repair of all of
the vessels of the Navy; the Bureau of Steam Engineering, whose head
is the Engineer in Chief of the Navy, with the rank of Rear Admiral,
and which has charge of the designing, construction and repair of the
engines and boilers in the ships of the Navy; a Bureau of Supplies and
Accounts, whose head is the Paymaster General of the Navy, with the
rank of Rear Admiral, and which has charge of the purchase and issue
of supplies and provisions for the Navy and the paying of the officers
and enlisted men; the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, whose head is the
Surgeon General of the Navy, with the rank of Rear Admiral, and which
has charge of the hospitals ashore, the hospital ships, and the health
and sanitation of the Navy both afloat and ashore; the Bureau of Yards
and Docks, whose Chief has the rank of Rear Admiral, and which has
charge of the designing and construction and repair of the buildings
and docks at the shore establishments of the Navy; and the Office of
the Judge Advocate General, whose head is the Judge Advocate General of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the Navy with the rank of Captain, and which has charge of the
courts-martial and legal affairs of the Navy.</p>

<p>For purposes of command and organization afloat and ashore the officers
of the Navy are divided into the “Line,” composed of the officers
holding the military command in the various ranks, and of a number of
“Staff Corps,” composed of officers who have charge of the various
coordinate duties.</p>

<p>These “Staff Corps” are the Medical Corps, the Pay Corps, the
Chaplains, the Corps of Naval Constructors, the Corps of Civil
Engineers and the Professors of Mathematics. Prior to 1899 there was
also a separate Corps of Engineers, but in that year this corps was
consolidated with the Line and since that time the only officers
holding the ranks of Chief Engineer, Passed Assistant Engineer and
Assistant Engineer in the Navy are officers of the old Engineer Corps
who are now carried on the Retired List of Officers.</p>

<p><i>The Marine Corps.</i>—The Marine Corps is a distinct military
organization normally forming an integral part of the Navy, but when
the President so orders any portion of the corps may be detached for
service with the Army, and in every war in which the United States has
been engaged the marines have fought as a part of the crews of the
fighting ships of the Navy, as landing forces and expeditionary forces
with the Navy and also on detached service with the Army.</p>

<p>The Marine Corps is commanded by a Major General Commandant whose
station is at Headquarters of the Corps in Washington, and who
is assisted by a staff consisting of an Adjutant and Inspector’s
Department, a Quartermaster’s Department and a Paymaster’s Department,
each headed by a Brigadier General.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The officers of the Adjutant and Inspector’s Department perform the
duties that are performed in the Army by the Departments of the
Adjutant General and the Inspector General; the Quartermaster’s
Department has charge of the supplies, provisions, transportation
and the construction and maintenance of barracks and buildings; and
the Paymaster’s Department has charge of the accounts and pay of the
officers and enlisted men of the Corps.</p>

<p>Detachments of the marines are stationed at all of the Navy Yards and
Naval Stations of the United States both at home and abroad, and they
also serve as Legation Guards for American Legations in countries
where such guards are considered necessary, as expeditionary forces
with the Fleet and for the protection of Americans and their rights
in foreign countries during revolutions and disorders, on detached
duty with the Army as circumstances require in time of war, and aboard
the battleships and cruisers of the Navy as a part of the crew, their
special duties aboard ship being as crews for the Torpedo Defense
batteries of guns of intermediate caliber and rapid-fire guns.</p>

<p>The Marines of a Fleet are organized into a regiment for duty as
a landing force, the detachment from each ship forming one of the
companies, and the Colonel commanding the regiment serves on the Staff
of the Admiral in command of the Fleet.</p>

<p>When assigned to shore duty the Marines are organized into permanent
companies, these companies being combined into provisional battalions,
regiments and brigades according to the service or duty required.</p>

<p>The Marine Detachment or company serving on board a ship of the Navy
is paraded as the guard of honor when such a guard is turned out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
receive the President, the ruler of any foreign country, or any lesser
officer or official entitled to such honors.</p>

<p><i>The Coast Guard.</i>—The Coast Guard was established by act of Congress
in January, 1915, which provided that the then existing Revenue-Cutter
Service and Life-Saving Service should be combined into one service
to be known as the Coast Guard, which shall constitute a part of the
military forces of the United States and which shall operate under the
Treasury Department in time of peace and operate as a part of the Navy,
subject to the orders of the Navy Department, in time of war, or at
other times when the President shall so direct.</p>

<p>In time of peace the Coast Guard is charged with the enforcement of
the revenue laws as applying to sea-borne commerce, with giving aid to
vessels in distress at sea, with the protection of the seal fisheries,
and with maintaining and operating the life-saving stations along the
coasts of the United States and its insular possessions. In time of war
or when so directed by the President it acts as a part of the Navy,
and the ships and personnel of the service become to all intents and
purposes a portion of the regular navy.</p>

<p><i>The Lighthouse Service.</i>—This service is charged with the duties
of establishing and maintaining the lighthouses and other aids to
navigation, such as buoys and beacons and range marks on shore, that
are required for the safe navigation of the waters adjacent to our
coasts, the harbors and the channels leading to them, and the inland
waterways.</p>

<p>In normal times the Lighthouse Service is operated under the Department
of Commerce, but by act of Congress of August, 1916, the President is
authorized to transfer the stations, vessels, equipment and personnel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of the service, as may be required, to the jurisdiction of the Navy
Department or to that of the War Department.</p>

<p>When so transferred to the Navy Department or to the War Department,
the Lighthouse Service becomes for the time being a portion of the
Navy or of the Army, as the case may be, and its officers and men are
subject to the laws and regulations of the service to which it is so
transferred.</p>

<p><i>The Coast and Geodetic Survey.</i>—This branch of the government service
is charged with surveying the harbors and waters contiguous to the
coasts of the United States and the insular possessions thereof and the
lakes and inland waterways contained therein, and with making charts
from such surveys for use in navigation.</p>

<p>The service is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce,
but in time of war its vessels may be transferred to the Navy
Department and their crews taken into the naval service, in which case
they become subject to the laws and regulations of the Navy.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rank, Title and Precedence</span></h3>

<p>Rank in its military sense is the character or quality bestowed upon
the men of the military and naval services which carries with it the
eligibility to exercise command or authority over other members of the
services within the limits prescribed by law and regulation. Rank is
divided into many different grades to mark the relative positions of
the persons upon whom it is conferred and to limit the extent of the
authority carried with it.</p>

<p>In all of the services of the United States, “Commissioned Officers”
are those who have received a commission from the President “by and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States”; and
“Appointed Officers” are those who are appointed by the President or by
his order but who are not “commissioned” and confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>In the Army the “Appointed Officers” are Aviators, Army Field Clerks,
Field Clerks Quartermaster Corps, and Cadets at the Military Academy.</p>

<p>In the Navy the “Appointed Officers” are Warrant Officers and
Midshipmen.</p>

<p>In the Marine Corps the “Appointed Officers” are Warrant Officers.</p>

<p>In the Army and Marine Corps “Noncommissioned Officers” are selected
enlisted men who are appointed to the various ranks of enlisted
authority by orders from their proper military commanders.</p>

<p>“Petty Officers” in the Navy are appointed enlisted men corresponding
to noncommissioned officers in the Army and Marine Corps.</p>

<p>The “Title” of an officer is the name of the rank or grade in which he
holds a commission, the formal term by which he is officially addressed
in communicating with him, although custom sanctions some variations
from this general rule.</p>

<p>In the Army and the Marine Corps all commissioned officers, line and
staff, have positive rank in the several grades, and it is customary
to address them when communicating orally with them by the name of
the rank they hold, the variations being that all General Officers
(Generals, Lieutenant Generals, Major Generals and Brigadier Generals)
are commonly addressed as “General,” that Lieutenant Colonels are
addressed as “Colonel,” and that all subalterns (First Lieutenants and
Second Lieutenants) are addressed as either “Lieutenant” or as “Mister.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Navy it is customary to address officers of the Line (the
command branch of the service) by the name of their rank, and to
address officers of the Staff Corps either by the name of their rank
or as “Mister,” for all except officers of the Medical Corps, who are
usually addressed as “Doctor.” The exceptions to this rule are that
all Flag Officers (Admirals, Vice Admirals and Rear Admirals) are
usually addressed orally as “Admiral,” and that Lieutenant Commanders,
Lieutenants and Ensigns are often addressed as “Mister.”</p>

<p>It is customary to address the Warrant Officers of the Navy and Marine
Corps as “Mister.”</p>

<p>The precedence of the commissioned officers and other officers of the
Army, Navy and Marine Corps is determined first by the grade or rank
which the officers hold by virtue of their commissions or appointments,
and if of the same grade or rank, then by the date of commission or
appointment in the grade. There are certain exceptions to this latter
rule in the case of some grades in the Staff Corps of the Navy.</p>

<p>The precedence of the warrant officers, noncommissioned officers
and petty officers of all the services is determined upon the same

<p><i>Chaplains</i> hold the relative rank of Captain, Commander, Lieutenant
Commander, Lieutenant or Lieutenant, Junior Grade, according to length
of service.</p>

<p><i>Professors of Mathematics</i> hold the rank of Captain, Commander,
Lieutenant Commander or Lieutenant according to length of service. This
corps was established to provide especially trained mathematicians for
duty as astronomers at the Naval Observatories and as Instructors at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the Naval Academy, but pursuant to the act of Congress of August 29,
1916, no further officers are to be commissioned in this corps.</p>

<p>In the days of sailing ships officers having the title of Sailmaker
were provided for the then important work of superintending the
manufacture of sails, but since the advent of steam and electricity
this branch has been discontinued and only a few are still borne on the
official register. The commissioned officers of this branch have the
title of Chief Sailmaker and relative rank the same as that of Chief
Boatswain, Chief Gunners, Chief Machinists, Chief Carpenters, Chief Pay
Clerks and Chief Pharmacists, that is, they rank with but next after Ensigns.</p>

<h3>MIDSHIPMEN</h3>

<p>Midshipmen are appointed officers undergoing the course of instruction
at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Each senator,
representative and delegate in Congress has the appointment of three
midshipmen to be at the Naval Academy at any one time, the President is
empowered to appoint two midshipmen and the Secretary of the Navy is
empowered to appoint one hundred midshipmen each year to be selected
from enlisted men of the Navy and Marine Corps who are not over the age
of twenty years.</p>

<p>The Corps of Midshipmen consists of four classes, the First Class
corresponding to “seniors” at universities, the Second Class
corresponding to “juniors,” the Third Class corresponding to
“sophomores,” and the Fourth Class corresponding to “freshmen.”</p>

<p>The regular course of study is four years although the President was
authorized by the act of Congress of March 4, 1917, to reduce the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
course to three years for a period of two years from the passage of the act,
owing to the urgent need of more officers in the Navy.</p>

<h3>WARRANT OFFICERS</h3>

<p>Warrant officers form an intermediate class between the commissioned
officers and the enlisted personnel. They receive appointments from
the President but are not confirmed by the Senate. They are appointed
by selection from the most efficient and deserving enlisted petty
officers. After six years’ service as warrant officers, if found
qualified, they are commissioned by the President, “by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate,” as Chief Boatswains, Chief Gunners,
Chief Machinists, Chief Carpenters, Chief Sailmakers, Chief Pharmacists
and Chief Pay Clerks, as the case may be, to take rank with but next
after Ensigns.</p>

<p>All warrant officers take rank and precedence next after commissioned
officers, their relative rank among themselves being determined by date
of appointment.</p>

<p>Warrant officers are eligible to be commissioned as Ensigns after
passing the prescribed examination, in which case they are advanced
to higher rank in the same manner as other Ensigns commissioned after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
graduation from the Naval Academy. In this manner a young man who
proves himself worthy of the honor may rise from the lowest enlisted
grade to be an Admiral.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Enlisted Men of the Navy</span></h3>

<p>The highest grade of enlisted men in the U. S. Navy is that of Mate.
Mates are rated by authority of the Secretary of the Navy from seamen
of over two years’ service. They have no relative rank, but take
precedence over all other enlisted men. They wear a uniform like that
of warrant officers with a distinctive insignia as later described.</p>

<p>The classes of enlisted men in the Navy corresponding to the
“noncommissioned officers” of the Army and Marine Corps are styled
“Petty Officers.”</p>

<p>All of the enlisted men of the Navy are divided into branches according
to their principal duties, the different grades in these several
branches being as follows:</p>

<p class="center space-above1">PETTY OFFICERS</p>

<p>Petty Officers in the Navy correspond to the noncommissioned officers
of the Army, and they are divided into three general Branches, the
Seaman Branch consisting of the deck force which mans the guns of the
battery and performs the strictly “sailor” duties; the Artificer Branch
composed of the engineering force, the electricians, the carpenters and
the painters; and the Special Branch made up of yeomen, or clerical
force, the commissary stewards, cooks and bakers, the hospital nurses
and the bandsmen.</p>

<p>As a rule the special duties of each of the Petty Officers are
indicated by their titles, or “ratings,” as it is styled in the Navy,
as given in the list on <a href="#Page_37">pages 37-40</a>, but a few
words of explanation may not be amiss.</p>

<p>Masters-at-Arms are the policemen of the ship; boatswain’s mates are
the petty officers who assist the boatswain and see that the orders
of the officer of the deck are carried out in the different parts of
the ship; turret captains are the petty officers who have charge of
the turret guns crews under the Division Officer; gunner’s mates are
the petty officers who assist the gunner and see to the repairs of the
guns of the battery and have charge of the issue of powder and shell
from the magazines to the guns; gun captains are the petty officers in
charge of the individual gun crews; quartermasters are the petty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
officers who stand the watch at the wheel and steer the ship under the
orders of the Officer of the Deck; machinist’s mates are the petty
officers on duty at the engines and machinery; water tenders see that
the proper amount of water is kept in the boilers, and the duties of
the other petty officers are as indicated by their “ratings.”</p>

<p>The ordinary enlisted men are apportioned to the three branches in
the same manner as the petty officers, the Seaman Branch having seamen
gunners especially trained for duty at the guns, seamen, ordinary
seamen and apprentice seamen under training; the Artificer Branch
having firemen who tend the fires under the boilers, coal passers who
transfer the coal from the bunkers to the firerooms and landsmen or
untrained men; and the Special Branch having the musicians of the band
and buglers, and the lower ratings of cooks, bakers and hospital men.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br /><span class="h_subtitle">ENSIGNS, FLAGS AND PENNANTS</span></h2></div>

<p>The National Flag of a country is the flag which bears the device of
the nation, the emblem by which the nationality of the state is shown.</p>

<p>An Ensign is the flag or insignia used to show the nationality of the
armed forces of a nation; more properly speaking, it is the colors
displayed by a ship of war or carried by a regiment of soldiers.</p>

<p>In some countries flags of different designs from those of their
national flags are prescribed to be carried by the troops of the armies
or displayed as “colors” by the ships of war, but in the United States
of America the National Flag, the “Stars and Stripes,” is carried by
the Army and displayed as the colors by all ships of the Navy.</p>

<p>The flag of the United States was authorized by a resolution of
Congress of June 14, 1777, reading as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Resolved</i>, That the flag of the thirteen
United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the
union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new
constellation.</p>

<p>For the design of the flag made in accordance with this resolution
it was decided to make the stripes of equal width and the stars five-pointed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Vermont was admitted as a State in 1791 and Kentucky was admitted in
1792, and as a result an act of Congress approved on January 13, 1794,
provided:</p>

<p class="blockquot">That from and after the first day of May, Anno
Domini one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, the flag of the
United States be fifteen stripes, alternate red and white. That the
union be fifteen stars, white in a blue field.</p>

<p>The rapid increase in the number of States in the succeeding years
caused much confusion regarding the exact design of the flag and there
came to be a great diversity as to the numbers of stars and stripes. In
order to clear up all doubt the Fifteenth Congress passed an act, which
was approved by the President on April 4, 1818, entitled,</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">An Act to Establish the Flag of the United States</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in congress assembled</i>, That from and after
the fourth day of July next, the flag of the United States be thirteen
horizontal stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be twenty
stars, white in a blue field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>,
That on the admission of every new state into the Union, one star
be added to the union of the flag; and that such addition shall
take effect on the fourth day of July then next succeeding such
admission.</p>
</div>

<p>In accordance with this law there are at present forty-eight stars
in the union of the flag. The proportions of the national flag as
prescribed by the Presidential Executive Order No. 1637, dated October
29, 1912, are as follows:</p>

There is an exception made in these proportions in the case of the
flags carried by the troops, in which case the sizes are established by
special orders for the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>For the small flags flown by the small boats and launches of the ships
of war and other government ships the executive order places the
number of stars in the union at thirteen on account of the fact that
the identity of the several stars would be lost if the whole number of
forty-eight were used.</p>

<p>The Union Jack is a flag consisting of the union of the national flag,
and it is flown at the jackstaff in the bow of ships of war. Its size
should be the same as that of the union of the flag with which it is flown.</p>

<p>A pennant is triangular shaped, in some cases having a V-shaped notch
cut in the outer end of the fly.</p>

<p>The “commission pennant” is long and narrow, the portion next the
hoist, or mast, having a blue field with thirteen white stars and the
remainder being divided longitudinally into two parts, red and white.
It is flown at the mainmast head of all ships in commission which
have no officer on board above the rank of Captain in the Navy, and
indicates that the ship carrying it is “in commission,” or on active
service.</p>

<p>On ships of war carrying an officer senior in rank to a Captain the
prescribed distinctive flag for such officer is flown at the mainmast
head in place of the commission pennant, and the ship is known as a “Flagship.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Naval officers above the rank of Captain in the Navy
are called “Flag Officers.”</p>

<p>These distinctive flags of higher command are shown in the
illustrations. When two or more flag officers of the same grade are in
the same fleet the senior one flies the blue flag of his grade and all
the others fly the red flag of the grade.</p>

<p>On any one ship of war only the distinctive flag of the senior
officer of flag or higher rank is flown; thus, if the President is
aboard an Admiral’s flagship the flag of the President is flown but not
that of the Admiral.</p>

<p>In former times the flag was carried into the front line of battle
by the troops who used it as their rallying point, but in the battles
of to-day, where every attempt is made to disguise and screen the lines
of troops from the enemy, the flags and standards of the brigades and
regiments would serve to mark the exact position of the lines and thus
convey valuable information to the enemy and enable him to concentrate
the fire of artillery and machine guns upon them. Therefore the flags
are kept far in the rear to be carried in parades and ceremonies only
or when the victorious troops march in triumph through the streets of
cities captured from the enemy.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustrations the ensigns, flags and pennants
of the principal maritime nations are shown, the national flag and the
ensigns carried by the land troops being indicated in each case.</p>

<p>In addition to the flags of the United States shown in the
illustrations special flags are provided as distinguishing insignia
for the Naval Reserve, the Naval Militia of the several States and
territories, and for the merchant ships operated under the United
States Shipping Board.</p>

For the general officers and post commanders of the United States
Marine Corps flags and pennants of similar design, but with the
addition of the Marine Corps insignia in white added, are provided.</p>

<p><i>A Guidon</i> is a small flag or pennant carried by each troop of cavalry,
company of mounted engineers, battery of field artillery, mounted
company of the signal corps, field hospital, ambulance company and
motor truck company, to designate the unit which carries it.</p>

<p>The cavalry guidon is made up of two horizontal stripes, the upper
one red and the lower one white, the outer end being notched or cut
“swallow-tailed,” with the number of the regiment in white on the upper
stripe and the letter of the troop in red on the lower stripe.</p>

<p>The field artillery guidon is of the same shape and colors as the
cavalry guidon with the addition of two cannons crossed in the center,
the cannons and the regimental number and battery letter being in yellow.</p>

<p>The guidon for a company of mounted engineers is of the same shape as
the cavalry guidon, of scarlet with the corps insignia of the engineers
in the center, the word “<span class="smcap">MOUNTED</span>” above it and
the number of the company below it, the insignia, letters and numbers being
in silver embroidery.</p>

<p>The guidon for a mounted company of the signal corps is of the same
shape as the cavalry guidon, of orange with two flags crossed of white
with red centers in the center and the letter of the company in white
above them.</p>

<p>Each aero squadron carries a guidon of orange silk with the insignia of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the signal corps in white and red in the center, the number of the
squadron above the insignia in white and a white eagle with wings
spread below the insignia.</p>

<p>Each telegraph company carries a guidon similar to the one for the
aero squadron except that in place of the eagle there is a design
representing forked lightning.</p>

<p>The guidon for each field hospital organization and ambulance company
is of the same shape as the cavalry guidon, of maroon color, having in
the center the insignia of the hospital corps, a caduceus, in white,
with the number of the organization above the insignia and the initials
“F. H.” for field hospital or “A. C.” for ambulance company in white
below the insignia.</p>

<p>The guidon for a motor truck company is a pennant, triangular in shape,
of red, white and blue, the white portion being diamond shaped with one
of the horizontal points at the staff and the other at the outer end
of the pennant, the triangular portion above the white diamond next to
the staff being red and the corresponding triangular portion below the
white diamond being blue, with the quartermaster corps insignia in blue
at the center of the white diamond.</p>

<p>The flag of the Geneva Convention, to be used in connection with the
national flag in time of war with a country which was a signatory
of that convention, is a white flag having a red Greek cross in the
center. It is used to mark hospitals, hospital ships, field hospitals,
ambulances and ambulance vessels and boats. The size prescribed to mark
general hospitals in the United States Army is 5 feet hoist (high) by 9
feet fly (wide) with the red cross 4 feet high and 4 feet wide and the
arms of the cross 16 inches wide. The smaller Geneva Convention flags
are of the same general proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
An interesting development of warfare resulting from the increasing use
of aircraft in war is the use of distinguishing marks for the aircraft
of the different nations. At first the national flags were used for
this purpose, but it was found that they would not serve to identify
the nationality of the aeroplane or dirigible airship when viewed from
all directions and another system of distinguishing marks has been adopted.</p>

<p>These aircraft distinguishing marks for the aircraft of the
principal nations are <a href="#AIR_MARKS">shown in the accompanying
illustration</a>. In order that the aircraft carrying them may be
distinguished both from above and below these marks are painted on the
upper side of each upper wing and on the lower side of each lower wing
of aeroplanes and on both the upper and lower sides of the gas bags
of dirigible airships and balloons. The marks are also carried on the
sides of the fusilage near the bow and on the sides of the vertical
rudders of aeroplanes in many cases.</p>

<p class="space-below2">These distinguishing marks are necessary for
the aircraft employed in war in order that friend may be distinguished
from foe by the airmen and by the gunners and riflemen afloat and ashore.</p>

<p>The uniforms for the officers and enlisted men of the United States
Army are made of blue cloth for wear on dress occasions and of
olive-drab colored material for wear on general service and field
service occasions, and in addition the officers have uniforms of white
linen or cotton duck for wear as a dress uniform in the tropics or
during hot weather.</p>

<p>The service uniforms of the olive-drab color are made of woolen cloth
or serge for cold weather and of cotton duck for hot weather, the
latter being usually known as “khaki” uniforms, though the regulation
color is of a somewhat darker shade than that universally known as “khaki.”</p>

It is a general rule that the officers serving with the troops in
garrison or in the field must appear in the same style of uniform as
that prescribed for the enlisted men.</p>

<p>During peace times officers serving on detached duty or in the offices
of the Departments where there are no enlisted men on duty ordinarily
wear civilian clothes, but in time of war all officers and enlisted
men are required to wear the olive-drab service uniform at all times
except when the full dress and dress uniforms are prescribed for some
appropriate special occasion. Officers ordered on active field service
are required to carry with them only the service uniforms.</p>

<h3>UNITED STATES ARMY OFFICERS’ UNIFORMS</h3>

<p>Commissioned officers of the Army are required to have complete outfits
of service uniform (woolen olive-drab for temperate and cold weather
and cotton olive-drab or “khaki” for the tropics and hot weather),
dress uniform, full dress uniform, white uniform and special evening
dress uniform, and for wear on certain occasions in the evening a mess
dress uniform of blue and one of white is optional.</p>

<p>The occasions upon which these uniforms are usually worn are given in
the regulations as follows:</p>

<p><i>The service uniform</i> consists of a single-breasted sack coat extending
to one-third of the distance from the point of the hip to the knee,
fitting tightly at the waist, with a standing collar, buttoned down the

four patch pockets closed by pocket flaps buttoned with small size
army buttons of bronze, one pocket on each breast and one on each side
of the front below the waist, the shoulders having straps of the same
material as the coat extending from the shoulder seam to the base of
the collar secured with a small size bronze button at the collar end

In garrison the saber is worn suspended by tan leather slings from a
tan leather waist-belt, but for war service in the field the saber
is worn with a wide tan leather belt having a suspender strap of tan
leather worn from the right shoulder diagonally across the body to
rings in the belt in front and in rear of the left hip. This belt was
recently adopted from the British Army and is known as the “Sam Browne”
belt. In the trenches and on ordinary duty in the field, officers of
the Army wear the pistol belt on which the service automatic pistol is
carried in a leather or webbing holster.</p>

<p>Insignia of dull bronze metal indicating the arm of the service or the
staff corps to which the wearer belongs are worn upon both sides of the
collar of the service coat and the insignia of rank in bright metal, silver
or gold according to rank are worn upon each shoulder strap of the coat.</p>

<p>For certain drills and for service in the field the coat may be dispensed
with, in which case the olive-drab flannel shirt is worn and the corps insignia
and insignia of rank are then worn upon the collar of the shirt.</p>

<p>The hat cord worn on the service hat by General Officers is a double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
cord of gold bullion with acorns of the same material at the ends, and
that worn by other commissioned officers is the same except that it has
black silk intermixed with the gold.</p>

<p>Army Field Clerks and Field Clerks Quartermaster Corps wear hat cords
made of black and silver twisted strands.</p>

<p>Members of the Officers Training Corps undergoing training in the camps
provided for that purpose wear a hat cord made of red, white and blue
twisted strands.</p>

<p>The overcoat is worn with the service uniform when necessary.</p>

<p>Mounted officers wear tan boots, spurs and drab leather riding gloves
with the service uniform.</p>

<p><i>The dress uniform</i> consists of a dark blue cloth, single-breasted coat
extending to one-third of the distance from the point of the hip to the
knee; blue cloth trousers (the shade depending upon the rank and corps
of the wearer as later described); a bell-crowned cap, of dark blue
cloth having the coat of arms of the United States embroidered in gold
on the front of the crown at the center, with a sloping visor of black
patent leather and a chin strap of gold braid three-eighths of an inch
in width and eight inches long attached above the visor by a small gilt
Army button at each end of the visor; black shoes; white shirt, collar
and cuffs; and white gloves.</p>

<p>The dress coat for General officers (officers of the rank of General,
Lieutenant General, Major General and Brigadier General) is double
breasted with a standing and falling collar, two rows of buttons down
the front as follows: for a General twelve buttons in each row arranged
in three groups of four, for a Lieutenant General ten in each row
arranged in three groups, the upper and lower groups of three and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
central group of four, for a Major General nine in each row arranged in
three groups of three each, and for a Brigadier General eight in each
row arranged in groups of two; and the cuffs trimmed with three small
size gilt army buttons on each back seam. The collar has on each side
the proper insignia indicating staff corps, and on each shoulder there
is a shoulder strap four inches long and one and seven-eighths inches
wide with a border of raised gold embroidery three-eighths of an inch
wide, the field of the strap being of dark blue cloth and bearing the
stars indicating the rank of the General officer. These shoulder straps
are worn with one of the sides touching the shoulder seam of the sleeve.</p>

<p>The dress coat for all other officers is a single-breasted sack coat
of dark blue cloth, with a standing collar, closed in front by buttons
or hooks concealed by a fly, having a vertical opening on each side at
the hip six inches high, the collar, front edges, bottom edge of the
coat and the vertical side openings being trimmed with lustrous black
mohair braid one and one-half inches wide. On each shoulder a shoulder
strap of the same size as that described for General officers is worn,
the field of the strap being the distinctive color of the arm of the
service to which the wearer belongs and having the insignia of rank
embroidered upon it. On each side of the collar the corps insignia are
worn to indicate the corps or branch of the service to which the wearer
belongs.</p>

<p>The dress trousers for General officers (except Chief of Coast
Artillery, Chief of Engineers, Quartermaster General and General
Officers of the Quartermaster Corps) are made of dark blue cloth
without stripes or other trimming. For the General officers excepted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the last sentence the trousers are of dark blue cloth trimmed down the
outer leg seams with stripes as follows:</p>

<p><i>Chief of Coast Artillery.</i>—Stripes of scarlet cloth one and
one-half inches wide.</p>

wide with a one-eighth inch piping of white cloth in the center of each stripe.</p>

<p><i>Quartermaster General and General Officers of the Quartermaster
Corps.</i>—Stripes of buff cloth one and one-half inches wide.</p>

<p>For officers below the rank of Brigadier General the dress trousers
are of blue cloth with stripes of cloth one and one-half inches wide
down the outer leg seams, the color of the cloth for the trousers and
stripes depending upon the corps of the officer as follows:</p>

<p><i>Officers having permanent appointments in the Staff Corps</i> and
Departments (except Engineer and Quartermaster officers), dark blue

<p><i>Officers of Artillery.</i>—Sky-blue cloth with stripes of scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Officers of Infantry.</i>—Sky-blue cloth with stripes of white.</p>

<p>The dress cap for General officers (except the Quartermaster General,
Brigadier Generals of the Quartermaster Corps and the Chief of Coast
Artillery) has a band of blue-black velvet one and three-quarters inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
wide, upon which is embroidered in gold a design of oak leaves, and
upon the visor there are two sprays of oak leaves embroidered in gold.
The dress caps for the Quartermaster General and Brigadier Generals of
the Quartermaster Corps and for the Chief of Coast Artillery are the
same as for other General officers except that the cap for the Chief
of Coast Artillery has the band of scarlet velvet and that for the
Quartermaster General and Brigadier Generals of the Quartermaster Corps
have the band of buff velvet.</p>

<p>The dress cap for Field officers (Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels and
Majors) of all branches is the same as that for General officers,
except that the band is decorated with two bands of gold lace braid
one-half an inch wide, one at the top and one at the bottom of the
band with a strip of cloth three-quarters of an inch in width between

On the dress coats and overcoats the chevrons worn by the Cadet
Officers are of the same designs as those above described for the
full dress coats except that they are made of black cloth on a gray
background and those worn on the overcoats are of only one-third the
size of those for the full dress and dress coats.</p>

<p>The Cadets are divided into four classes according to the year’s course
they are pursuing, the first class corresponding to the seniors at a
college, the second class corresponding to the juniors, the third class
corresponding to the sophomores and the fourth class corresponding to
the freshmen.</p>

<p>The class to which a Cadet belongs is indicated by stripes worn upon
the sleeves of the full dress and dress coats and the overcoat, three
stripes for the first class, two stripes for the second class, one
stripe for the third class and none for the fourth class, thus each
stripe shows one year of service as a Cadet.</p>

<p>On the sleeves of the full dress coat these stripes are of gold
soutache braid placed diagonally across the outer side between the
wrist and the elbow; on the sleeves of the overcoat they are the same
as for the full dress coat except that they are made of black soutache
braid; and for the dress coat the stripes are of black soutache braid
placed across the outer side of the sleeve parallel to the broad black
braid on the cuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Cadets who are classed as “Distinguished” on account of high standing
in their studies and drills wear a five-pointed gold star on each side
of the collar of the full dress and dress coats.</p>

<p>The uniforms of the West Point cadets are of gray cloth for wear during
the winter and of white duck for wear during the summer, the color of
the winter uniforms being that which is usually known as “cadet gray.”
Each cadet is required to have complete outfits of full dress, dress
and white uniforms.</p>

<p><i>Their full dress uniform</i> consists of a full dress coat, gray or
white trousers, full dress hat, black leather shoes, white waist-belt and
white cross-belts. Cadet officers wear a plume of black feathers in the
hat, a white sword belt and a red silk sash. The Cadet Sergeant Major,
Cadet Quartermaster Sergeant and Cadet First Sergeants wear a white
sword belt and a red silk sash.</p>

<p class="space-below2">The full dress coat is of gray cloth, fitting closely, single-breasted,
with three rows of gilt bell buttons down the front, eight buttons in
each row, one row in the center and one row on each side, the coat
being cut away just below the waist line across the front and having
short skirts behind. The skirts of the coat have twelve gilt bell
buttons, three down the plait of each skirt, the upper one at the
waist, and three placed lengthwise on each skirt. The coat has a square
standing collar with one bell button on each side. Each cuff has three
bell buttons. The collar, front of the coat, the cuffs and the skirt of
the coat are trimmed with black silk cord in designs as shown in the
illustration.</p>

<p class="space-above1">The trousers for winter wear with both the full dress
and dress uniforms are of gray cloth with black stripes one and one-half inches
wide down the outer seams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
The full dress hat is of black felt, bell-crowned, six inches high,
with a sloping visor. It is trimmed with gilt decorations, bears the
insignia of the Military Academy on a gilt plate in front, has a black
pompon set in a gilt socket on the front at the center (a black plume
being worn by cadet officers, instead of the pompon), and a gilt scale
chain strap worn above the visor.</p>

<p>When mounted the cadets wear gray cloth breeches and riding
leggings instead of trousers.</p>

<p>The dress uniform of the cadets consists of a dress coat, dress cap,
gray or white trousers, black leather shoes, white waist-belt and white
cross-belts and leather gloves. Cadet officers wear a white sword belt
and a worsted sash.</p>

<p>The dress coat is of gray cloth, single-breasted, with a straight
standing collar, closed down the center of the front by buttons
concealed beneath a fly, the coat reaching to about nine inches below
the waist. The coat is trimmed around the collar, down the front,
around the bottom edge and up the side seams of the back with black
mohair braid one inch wide, the braid down the front being double.
There is also one stripe of the same braid around each sleeve two and
one-half inches from the lower edge of the cuff.</p>

<p>The dress cap is of gray cloth, bell-crowned, three and one-half inches
high, with a band of black mohair braid one and three-quarter inches
wide and a sloping visor of black patent leather. In the front and
center of the cap is worn the insignia of the United States Military
Academy in gilt metal one and three-quarter inches high.</p>

<p><i>The overcoat</i> is of gray kersey, double-breasted, with six buttons on
each side down the front, coat to reach within ten inches of the ground
when the wearer is standing. It has a stand and fall collar five inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
deep. There are also two buttons at the hip and one at the bottom of
each plait behind. All of the buttons are gilt, seven-eighths of an
inch in diameter, and bear the arms of the U. S. Military Academy with
the word “Cadet” around the margin at the top and the letters “U. S. M.
A.” around the margin at the bottom. There is also a cape of the same
material as the coat, cut circular, extending to the hip buttons. The
coat and cape are lined with gray woolen material.</p>

<p><i>The raincoat</i> is a sleeveless sack overcoat of gray waterproof
material with a cape attached to the coat, the skirts of the coat
extending to within eight inches of the ground.</p>

<p>The cadets are also furnished with a gray woolen shirt which is
sometimes worn at drills without the coat.</p>

<p>At certain of the drills and exercises a service hat of felt similar to
the “campaign hat” is worn.</p>

<h3>UNIFORM AND INSIGNIA OF FIELD CLERKS,<br /> U. S. ARMY</h3>

<p>By the Act of Congress of August 29, 1917, the grades of Army Field
Clerk and Field Clerk Quartermaster Corps were established in the
United States Army. These officers are appointed by the Secretary
of War and take precedence in rank next after Cadets and before all
noncommissioned officers, so that their position is similar in relative
rank to that of Warrant officers in the United States Navy and Marine Corps.</p>

<p>The Army Field Clerks belong to the Adjutant General’s Department and
the Field Clerks Quartermaster Corps are a part of that corps.</p>

<p>They wear the same uniform as commissioned officers, omitting all
insignia of rank and the brown bands of braid around the cuffs of the
service coat. On their service hats they wear a hat cord of black and
silver twisted strands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Army Field Clerks wear on each side of the collar of the service coat a
bronze insignia consisting of two quill pens crossed with a miniature
adjutant general’s shield in the lower angle.</p>

<p>Field Clerks Quartermaster Corps wear on each side of the collar of the
service coat a bronze insignia consisting of two quill pens crossed
with a miniature Quartermaster Corps insignia in the lower angle.</p>

<h3>ENLISTED MEN’S UNIFORMS, U. S. ARMY</h3>

<p>The enlisted men of the Army are required to have complete outfits
of service uniform for winter and summer, dress uniform and fatigue
uniform, and in addition cooks and bakers, members of the Hospital
Corps and members of the general recruiting service have white uniforms.</p>

<p>The occasions upon which the different uniforms are worn are given in

<i>The service uniform</i> for enlisted men of the Army consists of a single
breasted sack coat of olive-drab woolen or cotton material, extending
to about ten inches below the waist, with a standing collar, buttoned
down the front with one row of five regulation bronze buttons, having
four outside patch pockets, one on each breast and on each side below
the waist line, each pocket being closed with a shield shaped flap
buttoned by a small regulation button, and a strap of the same material
as the coat on each shoulder sewed in at the shoulder seam and buttoned
at the collar end by a small regulation button; breeches of the same
material as the coat, khaki-colored canvas leggings, tan leather shoes;
and a service cap or service hat. The service cap is a bell-crowned cap
with a sloping tan leather visor and a tan leather chin strap across
the front above the visor secured by a small bronze button at each
end of the visor. The service hat is the brown felt wide brimmed hat
universally called the “campaign hat” and is worn with what is known as
the “Montana peak,” that is, brought to a point at the center of the
top of the crown by making four dents in the top of the crown. A hat
cord of the distinctive color of the corps or arm of the service to
which the wearer belongs is worn around the base of the crown of the
service hat. During war the steel helmet is worn when on duty in the
trenches or on the battle line. In garrison the tan leather belt is
worn with the service uniform, and in the field the webbing cartridge
belt of the same color as the uniform is worn.</p>

<p>Mounted men wear spurs and tan leather leggings with this uniform.</p>

shoulder; the dress cap of dark blue cloth; sky-blue cloth trousers; a
white collar; and tan leather shoes. When under arms in this uniform
white gloves are worn except when the overcoat is worn, in which case
olive-drab gloves are worn. The dress coat is trimmed around the top
and base of the collar and down the front edges of the collar, around
the edges of the shoulder straps and around each sleeve four inches
from the bottom edge by a narrow piping of the distinctive color of the
arm of the service or corps to which the wearer belongs, and there are
three small regulation gilt buttons on each cuff and one at the collar
end of each shoulder strap.</p>

distinctive color down the outer leg seams, the stripes for corporals
being one-half inch wide and those for higher noncommissioned officers
being one and one-quarter inches wide, those for musicians being
double, each part one-half inch wide.</p>

bell crown, a black patent leather sloping visor and a half-inch chin
strap of patent leather worn above the visor and secured by a gilt
button at each end of the visor. There is one stripe around the band of
the cap at the upper edge of the band and one at the lower edge of the
band, each stripe being one-half inch in width and of the distinctive
color of the corps or arm of the service to which the wearer belongs,
these distinctive colors being those as given for the “facings.”</p>

buttoning to the neck with two rows of large flat buttons of the same
color as the coat, and having a wide rolling collar. It has a pleat
down the center of the back.</p>

<h3>INSIGNIA OF RANK FOR ENLISTED MEN</h3>

<p>The rank of the various noncommissioned officers of the United States
Army and Marine Corps and the rating of the corresponding petty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
officers of the Navy is usually indicated by chevrons, a form of badge
derived from the days when heraldry played a great part in the world’s
affairs.</p>

<p>“Chevron” is an architectural term denoting the rafters of a roof
meeting at an angle at the upper apex, and it is derived from the
French word “<i>chevre</i>,” a goat, and so used on account of the fancied
resemblance of a pair of such rafters to the horns of a goat.</p>

<p>The chevron in heraldry was employed as a badge of honor to mark the
main supporters of the head of the clan, “the top of the house,” and it
came to be used in various forms as an emblem of rank for the knights
and men-at-arms in feudal days, and from this resulted its common use
as an insignia of rank in the armies and navies of the present day.</p>

<p>In some countries chevrons are used as insignia of rank for
commissioned officers as well as for noncommissioned officers, but in
the United States service the use of chevrons is confined to the latter
class.</p>

<p>In the United States Army and Marine Corps the chevrons are worn with
the point up but in the Navy they are worn with the point down.</p>

<p>The chevrons indicating the rank of noncommissioned officers are worn
midway between the shoulder and the elbow on both sleeves of the
service coats, full dress coat and overcoat.</p>

<p>The chevrons for the dress coat are 3¼ inches wide made of stripes of
cloth of the distinctive color of the corps, department or arm of the
service, each stripe being ⅜ of an inch wide.</p>

<i>Brassards</i> are bands of cloth worn on the sleeves to
designate officers and men assigned to special duties.</p>

<p><i>Red Cross Brassard.</i>—In time of war with signatories of the Geneva
Convention all persons in the military services who are rendered
neutral by the terms of that convention wear upon the left arm above
the elbow a brassard of white cloth bearing upon it a Geneva cross
in red cloth while on duty in the field of operations. The persons
entitled to wear this brassard are surgeons, members of the hospital
corps, nurses, chaplains and the personnel engaged exclusively with the
removal and transportation of the sick and wounded.</p>

<p><i>Brassards</i> worn on the right upper arm are of the following
distinctive colors: <i>blue</i> for agents and signalmen, <i>green</i> for guides
and scouts, <i>red</i> for orderlies and messengers, <i>white</i> for trench
cleaners, <i>yellow</i> for members of parties carrying munitions, material,
food or water, <i>khaki with the word “Salvage” in red letters</i> for
members of salvage parties, and <i>blue with the letters “M. P.” outlined
in white thread</i> for members of the Military Police.</p>

<p><i>Field Clerk’s Brassard.</i>—Field clerks of Engineers wear upon the left
arm above the elbow a brassard of maroon colored cloth with white edges.</p>

<p><i>Service Stripes.</i>—All enlisted men of the Army who have served one or
more enlistments in the Army, Navy or Marine Corps wear one stripe for
each such enlistment on each sleeve of the dress coat midway between
the wrist and the elbow. These service stripes are three-eighths of an inch
in width and are placed diagonally across the outside of the sleeve.</p>

<p>The color of the stripe is that of the branch of the service in which
the enlistment that it represents was served, as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">Cavalry, yellow.</li>
<li class="isub3">Artillery, scarlet.</li>
<li class="isub3">Engineers, scarlet piped with white.</li>
<li class="isub3">Infantry, white.</li>
<li class="isub3">Hospital Corps, maroon piped with white.</li>
<li class="isub3">Ordnance, black piped with scarlet.</li>
<li class="isub3">Signal Corps, orange piped with white.</li>
<li class="isub3">Quartermaster Corps, buff.</li>
<li class="isub3">Service School Detachment, green.</li>

<li class="isub3">U. S. Navy, scarlet piped with yellow.</li>
<li class="isub3">U. S. Marine Corps, yellow piped with scarlet.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Buttons.</i>—The buttons worn by enlisted men of the Army on the dress
coat are of gilt metal and bear the coat of arms of the United States
in relief; those worn on the service coats are of the same size and
design but are made of dull finish bronze metal, and those worn on the
overcoat are large bronze flat buttons of the same design.</p>

<p><i>Identification Tag.</i>—Each officer and enlisted man of the U. S. Army
is required to wear two aluminum identification tags about the size
of a silver half dollar whenever the field kit is worn, one tag to be
suspended from the neck underneath the clothing by a cord or thong
of leather passed through a hole in the tag, the second tag being
suspended from the first one by a cord or thong. Each tag bears stamped
upon it the name, rank, company, regiment and corps of the wearer. This
tag is for use in identifying the wearer in case of death or serious
wounds. In case of death one tag is buried with the body and the
duplicate is kept with the record of the place of burial and the cause
and date of death.</p>

<i>Identification Patch.</i>—In order that the men in an advance line of
attack upon the battlefield may be recognized by the officers who
are controlling their advance and accurately placing the curtain of
shrapnel fire ahead of them, it has become necessary to prescribe
identification patches upon the backs of the men’s coats between the
shoulders. These identification patches are of different designs
and colors to mark the different regiments and brigades, circles,
triangles, squares and other shapes being used. The shape and color of
these patches is not laid down in uniform regulations in the United
States Army, but these details are prescribed from time to time in
orders from Headquarters of the Field Armies.</p>

<p><i>United States Guards</i>, <i>National Army</i>, are organized into battalions
for guard duty in the United States during the period of the existing
emergency. Their prescribed uniform is the blue dress uniform of the
regular army with blue overcoats and the customary insignia.</p>

<p><i>Citizen’s Training Camps.</i>—The uniform for members of these camps
consist of olive-drab shirt, breeches and coat, canvas leggings, russet
shoes, and field hat with red, white and blue hat cord. The bronze
letters “U. S. T. C.” are worn on the collar, and on the left forearm a
badge with the same letters.</p>

<p><i>Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.</i>—The uniforms are olive-drab or
“Cadet gray.” Insignia of rank are of white metal for cadet officers
and gilt for instructors; <i>Colonel</i>, three diamonds; <i>Lieutenant
Colonel</i>, two diamonds; <i>Major</i>, one diamond; <i>Captain</i>, three disks;
<i>First Lieutenant</i>, two disks, <i>Second Lieutenant</i>, one disk. Sergeants
and corporals wear chevrons prescribed for the Regular Army. On the cap
is a wreath enclosing the letters “R. O. T. C.” in bronze and the same
letters are worn on the collar. On the left arm is a badge with “R. O.
T. C.” embroidered in the color of the arm of the service.

<p>In time of war the uniform prescribed for all ordinary occasions of duty
is service dress, blue or white depending upon the temperature and weather.</p>

<p><i>The special full dress</i> uniform consists of the cocked hat, a double
breasted coat with tails at the back only as is the case in the
ordinary civilian evening dress coat, trousers with gold stripes down
the outer leg seams, black shoes, gold epaulets and the sword carried
from a belt and slings of black cloth having gold stripes through it.</p>

<p><i>The full dress</i> uniform consists of the same trousers, cocked hat,
sword and belt as for special full dress, with a double-breasted frock
coat with a rolling collar and lapels, and gold epaulets.</p>

<p><i>The evening dress uniform</i> consists of a dark blue cloth evening dress
coat and a white waistcoat cut after the prevailing style for civilian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
evening dress but fitted with gilt navy buttons, plain dark blue
trousers, black patent leather shoes and the blue or white cap.
Epaulets and full dress trousers (with the gold stripes on them) may be
prescribed, in which case the uniform is known as <i>evening full dress</i>
and the cocked hat is worn with it. For wear in hot weather a <i>mess
jacket</i> of white is prescribed, cut after the fashion of the evening
dress coat but without tails. The shoulder marks are worn with the mess
jacket to indicate corps and rank, and either white or blue trousers
may be worn with it.</p>

<p><i>The undress</i> uniform consists of the frock coat without epaulets,
plain dark blue or white trousers, the blue or white undress cap, black
shoes and the sword carried from a black leather belt and slings.</p>

<p><i>The blue service dress</i> uniform consists of a dark blue single
breasted coat extending to about eight inches below the waist, with
standing collar, buttoned up the front with the buttons concealed by a
fly-front, and trimmed around the collar, down the front, around the
bottom and up the side seams of the back with one and a quarter inch
black mohair braid, the undress cap, plain dark blue trousers and black
shoes. The white cap and white trousers are sometimes worn with the
blue service dress coat.</p>

<p><i>The white service dress</i> uniform consists of a single-breasted
white duck coat extending to about eight inches below the waist, with
standing collar, buttoned up the front with five large size gilt navy
buttons, with a patch pocket on each breast closed by a flap at the
top buttoned by a small size gilt navy button, without braid trimming,
and having on each shoulder a shoulder strap (known in the service as
a “shoulder mark”) about five inches long and two and a quarter inches
wide bearing the insignia which indicates the corps or branch of the
Navy to which the wearer belongs and his rank as an officer, plain
white trousers, white cap and white shoes.</p>

<h3>NAVAL AVIATION CORPS INSIGNIA</h3>

<p>The Naval Aviation Corps insignia consist of a vertical foul
anchor surcharged with a shield of the United States with eagle’s
wings extending to the right and left of it as shown in the above
illustration. These insignia are made of gilt metal and are worn upon
the left breast by all Aviators in the Naval Service, that is by
all officers and enlisted men of the Navy and Marine Corps who have qualified
as Aviators and are detailed to duty with the Naval Aviation Corps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The summer service flying uniform</i> for officers of the Navy detailed
for aviation duty and for officers of the Naval Reserve Flying Corps
consists of a khaki coat of the same style as the white service coat,
with which the shoulder marks indicating rank are worn, khaki breeches,
woolen wrap puttees of drab color, tan shoes, and a khaki cap of the
same style as the white cap.</p>

<p><i>The working uniform</i> for officers detailed for aviation duty and for
officers of the Naval Reserve Flying Corps is a one-piece overall suit
of khaki-colored cotton duck, canvas or moleskin.</p>

<p><i>Dungarees</i> (or overalls), consisting of a blue denim jacket and pair
of trousers, are worn by officers when working in engine and firerooms
and in turrets and magazines.</p>

<p>When the sword is worn with the service dress uniforms the belt is worn
under the coat unless the pistol is worn on the belt, in which case the
belt is worn outside of the coat.</p>

<p>White gloves are worn with all uniforms on dress occasions or when the
sword is worn except at battle drills or with landing forces on shore
expeditions.</p>

<p>The overcoat is a dark blue ulster-coat, reaching about midway from the
knee to the foot, double-breasted, buttoning to the neck with seven
large flat black buttons on each side, with a wide rolling collar, with
a pocket having a vertical opening on each side above the waist, and
fitted with waist straps at the back. Shoulder marks of the same design
as those for the white service coat are worn with the overcoat and the
rank of the wearer is indicated by stripes of black mohair braid on the
lower part of the sleeve. The overcoat is lined with black, and a hood
is provided to be worn over the head in very cold weather.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>A boat cloak or cape of dark blue cloth, cut full, with a rolling
collar of black velvet is also provided for officers of the Navy.</p>

<p>The rain coat is a black mackintosh with a cape reaching to the tips
of the fingers when the arms hang naturally; and in rainy and wet
weather at sea officers usually wear rubber boots, oilskin coats and
“sou-wester” hats.</p>

<p>The cocked hat for officers of flag rank (admirals, vice admirals,
rear admirals and commodores) is of black silk beaver trimmed with gold
lace braid as shown in the illustration, <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 3</a>;
and for all other commissioned officers, except chaplains and chief warrant
officers, it is trimmed around the outer edge of the top of the crown with
black silk lace braid as <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">shown by figure 1</a>.</p>

<p>The blue cap for flag officers is <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">shown by figure 4</a>,
and for captains and commanders by figure 5, the cap for officers of the Staff Corps
of the rank of rear admiral is <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">shown by figure 6</a>, and for
the same classes of officers of the ranks of captain and commander by <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 7</a>.
The decorations on the visor shown in the illustrations are embroidered in
gold, with the exception of caps for chaplains of the ranks of captain
and commander, which have black embroidered bands as shown by <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 8</a>.</p>

<p>The chin strap for all commissioned officers except chaplains is of
black leather covered with gold lace braid one-half inch wide; for
chaplains it is made of lustrous black mohair, as <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">shown by figure 8</a>.
The chin strap for warrant officers’ caps is one-quarter of an inch in
width, <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 10</a>.</p>

<p>The cap device embroidered on the center and front of the caps of all
commissioned officers consists of a silver shield emblazoned paleways
of thirteen pieces, with chief strewn with stars, surmounted by a
silver spread eagle, the whole placed upon two crossed foul anchors in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
gold, as shown by the illustration. The cap device for warrant
officers’ caps consists of the two crossed foul anchors in gold, as
shown by <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 10</a>.</p>

<p>The blue cap for all commissioned officers below the rank of commander
has a plain black patent leather visor, <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 9</a>.</p>

<p>The white caps for all officers are similar in shape to the blue caps,
the band, cap devices, chin straps and visor decorations for the
different corps and ranks being the same as for the blue caps of the
same officers, <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 2</a>.</p>

<p>The cap for Warrant officers is the same as that for commissioned
officers except that the device worn on the front consists of two
gold foul anchors crossed and the chin strap of gold braid is but
one-quarter of an inch wide, <a href="#OFFICER_HATS">figure 10</a>.</p>

<h3>INSIGNIA OF RANK AND CORPS</h3>

<p>The rank of officers of the Navy is indicated in four ways: first, by
stripes upon the sleeves of the special full dress coat, frock coat,
evening dress coat, blue service coat and overcoat; second, by rank
insignia on each side of the front opening of the collar of the blue
service coat; third, by stripes upon the shoulder marks (or straps)
worn on the white service coat, the mess jacket and the overcoat; and
fourth, by rank insignia on the upper surface of the epaulets worn
with special full dress, full dress and evening dress. These stripes
indicating rank encircle the sleeves, the lower one being two inches
above the edge of the sleeve and parallel to it; on all blue coats
except the overcoat they are of gold lace braid, except for chaplains
who wear black braid stripes; and on the overcoats of all commissioned
officers they are of black mohair braid.</p>

<p>The Corps or branch of the service to which the officer belongs is

<p><i>Dental Corps</i>: a gold spread oak leaf with a silver acorn on either
side of the stem, one and three-quarter inches long and one inch wide.</p>

Aiguilettes worn by Naval Officers are loops of plaited blue and gold
cord terminating in gilt metal ornaments decorated with silver anchors.
They are worn by personal aids to the President and the Secretary of
the Navy, aides at the White House, members of the personal staff of a
Flag Officer in command of a fleet or subdivision of a fleet, and by
aides to the Commandants of Naval Stations and the Superintendent of
the Naval Academy.</p>

<p>The personal aides to the President wear the aiguilettes on the right
side and all other officers for whom they are prescribed wear them on
the left side.</p>

<p>They are worn with all uniforms to indicate the special duty of the
wearer as an aide entitled to convey the orders of the officer to whose
staff he is assigned.</p>

<p><i>The Sword knot</i> for naval officers is a loop of gold braid ending in
a bullion tassel, worn on the hilt of the sword. The original purpose
of this loop was to wear it around the right wrist when the sword was
carried in the hand to prevent the loss of the sword if it should be
accidentally dropped or knocked from the hand in combat. The sword knot
is worn by commissioned officers only.</p>

<p><i>Officers of the Line and of the Staff Corps of the Naval Reserve
Force</i> wear the same rank marks as those described for the officers
of the regular Navy, but, instead of the silver anchor for the Line
Officers and the various Corps devices and insignia to indicate the
Corps or branch of the service of the Staff officers of the Staff of
the regular Navy, they wear the Naval Reserve Force device on the
collar of the blue service coat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The Naval Reserve Force Device or insignia is of the same design as the
device worn on the front of the cap by commissioned officers of the
Navy. It is one inch in height, made of metal, the shield and eagle
being of silver and the crossed anchors of gold.</p>

<p>The gilt buttons worn by officers of the Naval Reserve Force are of the
same sizes as those worn by the officers of the regular service but
the design is different, and by this design the fact that an officer
is a member of the Naval Reserve Force is shown when he is wearing any
uniform having gilt buttons. The Naval Reserve Force gilt button for
officers bears a plain vertical anchor and the letters U. S. N. R., as
illustrated.</p>

<h3>UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF MIDSHIPMEN</h3>

The midshipmen are divided into four classes, according to the
year’s course, the first class corresponding to seniors at college,
the second class corresponding to juniors at college, the third
class corresponding to sophomores at college and the fourth class
corresponding to freshmen at college.</p>

<p>To distinguish the class to which they belong all midshipmen, except
Midshipman Officers and petty officers and fourth classmen, wear
service stripes of gold braid one-eighth of an inch wide diagonally
across the outside of each sleeve of the full dress jacket, service
coat and overcoat from front seam to rear seam, each stripe indicating
one year of service at the Naval Academy; thus, the first classmen have
three stripes, the second classmen two stripes, the third classmen one
stripe, and the fourth classmen plain sleeves with no stripes.</p>

<h3>ENLISTED MEN’S UNIFORMS, U. S. NAVY</h3>

<p><i>The blue dress uniform</i> for chief petty officers and for officers’
cooks and stewards consists of a double-breasted blue cloth coat
with rolling lapel collar and two lower and one breast pocket with
flaps, the coat to be worn buttoned, blue cloth trousers, black shoes,
a dark blue cloth cap with patent leather visor, white shirt and
collar and black bow tie, as illustrated. For all other enlisted men
(except bandsmen whose uniform is described later), the blue dress
uniform consists of a blue overshirt with a rolling collar, blue
cloth trousers, blue flat cap, black neckerchief and black shoes,
as illustrated. The overshirt collar falls down the back about nine
inches for a width of from fourteen to eighteen inches and is trimmed
around the edges with three stripes of narrow white braid and a white
five-pointed star in each corner. The overshirt is cut to fit loosely
with a shield shaped yoke at the top and a draw string at the waist,
the length being such that when the draw string is tightened at the
waist the shirt will fall two to four inches below it. The sleeves
have tight buttoned cuffs and these are trimmed with stripes of narrow
white braid, three stripes for petty officers of the first, second
and third classes and men of the seaman first class; two stripes for
men of the seaman second class, and one stripe for men of the seaman
third class and mess attendants, the men of these different classes
being enumerated in the table in Chapter II. The trousers for chief
petty officers are cut after the style for civilian trousers, but for
other enlisted men they are made to fit snug over the hips with a black
ribbon lacing at the back, closed in front by a square flap front with
small black buttons at the sides and top, and cut bell shaped at the
bottom in order that they may be rolled up easily. The blue cap for all
enlisted men except chief petty officers, officers’ stewards and cooks,
and bandsmen, is of the style known as the “flat cap.” It has a band
two inches wide around which is sewn a black silk cap ribbon bearing
the name of the ship or station of the wearer in plain gold letters,
the ribbon being tied in a double-bow knot at the left side. Above the
band the crown is about four inches greater in diameter than the band
and is stretched out flat by a “grommet” or ring worn inside of the
edge of the crown.</p>

<i>The white dress uniform</i> for chief petty officers and officers’
stewards and cooks consists of a white duck coat, white duck trousers,
white cap, white shirt and collar, black tie and white shoes, the coat
and trousers being made after the same style as the blue dress coat,
and the cap having a black visor and band and a white crown. For all
other enlisted men (except bandsmen) the white dress uniform consists
of a white dress “jumper” shirt with blue cloth collar and cuffs, white
trousers, black neckerchief, black shoes and a white hat. The white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
dress jumper is not tightened at the waist like the blue overshirt but is
cut off square about six inches below the waist and allowed to hang free.</p>

<p><i>The blue undress uniform</i> for chief petty officers and officers’
stewards and cooks is the same as the blue dress uniform for these men
except that the material of which it is made is blue serge and a blue
flannel shirt may be worn. For all other enlisted men (except bandsmen)
the blue undress uniform consists of a blue undress jumper, blue cloth
or flannel trousers, blue cap or white hat and black shoes. The blue
undress jumper is the same as the overshirt except that there are no
stripes of braid or stars on the collar or cuffs and the sleeves are
not buttoned at the cuff but cut off square and hemmed.</p>

<p><i>The white undress uniform</i> for chief petty officers and officers’
stewards and cooks is the same as the white dress for these men. For
all other enlisted men (except bandsmen) it consists of a white undress
jumper of the same style as the blue undress jumper and white trousers
and white hat, the jumper and trousers being made of white navy drill.</p>

<p><i>The working dress uniform</i>, blue or white, for all enlisted men is
the same as undress, blue or white as the case may be, except that chief
petty officers and officers’ stewards and cooks may go without the coat
and wear the blue flannel shirt if in blue, and other enlisted men do
not wear the neckerchief and may wear the watch cap when in blue. The
watch cap is a dark blue knitted cap without visor or brim that may be
pulled down over the ears for cold weather.</p>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<i>Winter Service Uniform.</i>—At various times in the past when vessels
of the Navy have been detailed for long periods of duty in the Arctic
regions or where the weather conditions are particularly cold and
severe, special uniforms have been authorized to be worn by the
officers and enlisted men making up the personnel of such expeditions.
For the Arctic expeditions these special uniform suits have usually
been made of fur similar in pattern to the garments worn by the natives
of the Far North.</p>

<p>The conditions under which the Destroyer Flotillas and Patrol Squadrons
must operate off the coasts of Northern Europe during the severe
weather of the winter months has necessitated the design of a special
uniform for their crews. This winter storm uniform consists of heavy
waterproof boots of the style known as “Arctics”; wind and rain proof
trousers of heavy material; an overshirt of specially heavy wool with a
hood; and a wind and rain proof coat with a hood to be worn over all.</p>

<p>While the appearance of a sailor dressed in this uniform is very
different from that which we are accustomed to see upon the decks
of the trim and smart vessels of the United States Navy, it is made
necessary by the severe conditions of the service demanded and adds to
efficiency in that it serves to keep the men dry and warm and able to
perform their duties when the little vessels of the patrol fleet are
swept by heavy seas and chilling gales.</p>

<p><i>Dungaree suit</i> consists of a jumper and trousers made
 of blue denim drill.</p>

<p><i>Gloves</i> for enlisted men are made of dark gray wool.</p>

<p><i>Bathing trunks</i> of dark blue material are required to be worn by all
men bathing “over the side” from a ship.</p>

<p><i>Pajamas</i> consisting of a shirt and trousers of light weight white
cotton drill are provided for enlisted men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Overcoats</i> for chief petty officers are of dark blue cloth, double
breasted, buttoning to the neck with two rows of large black buttons,
with a rolling collar, two vertical breast pockets and two lower side
pockets with flaps. For all other enlisted men (except bandsmen) the
overcoat is the same style but reaches only to the tips of the fingers
when the arms hang at the sides.</p>

<p><i>Uniforms for bandsmen of the navy</i> consist of a blue dress coat, white
dress coat, sky-blue trousers, white trousers, blue cap, and white cap,
all of the same design and cut as those for the enlisted men of the U.
S. Marine Corps (<a href="#Page_64">described in Chapter VI</a>) except that
navy buttons are worn instead of marine corps buttons, a lyre device
is worn on the cap, instead of the marine corps device, and the navy
“rating badges” are worn by the bandmaster and first musicians instead
of the chevrons worn by the noncommissioned officers of the marine
corps.</p>

<p><i>The overcoat</i> for bandsmen is of sky-blue cloth, double-breasted,
buttoning to the neck with two rows of gilt navy buttons, lined with
red flannel, falling collar five inches deep, cut to reach about six
inches below the knee, and provided with a circular cape of the same
color.</p>

<p>The rank and special duty (or “rating” as it is styled in the navy) of
the petty officers of the first, second and third classes, as given in
the <a href="#TABLE_PETTY">table on page 38</a>, is shown by a “rating badge”
which is worn on the right sleeve between the elbow and the shoulder by
petty officers of the Seaman Branch and in the corresponding position
on the left sleeve by all other petty officers.

<p>The rating badge consists of a spread eagle above a “specialty mark”
showing the duty and a chevron showing the “class” or rank of the
wearer. These badges are three and one-quarter inches broad.</p>

<p>The chevrons are made of stripes of cloth three-eighths of an
inch wide, placed one-quarter of an inch apart as shown in the
illustrations. A peculiarity of the navy chevrons is that they are
worn with the apex of the angle formed by the two bars of each stripe
pointing down instead of up as in the army and marine corps.</p>

<p>The specialty marks are placed in the center of the angle formed by the
upper stripe of the chevron and the spread eagle is placed just above
the specialty mark.</p>

<p>For use on blue clothing the chevrons are made of scarlet cloth and the
eagle and specialty marks are embroidered in white; while for white
clothing the chevrons are of blue cloth and the specialty marks and
eagle are embroidered in blue.</p>

<p>For petty officers holding three consecutive good-conduct badges
(namely, the good-conduct medal and two bars, representing three full
enlistments served with efficiency and good conduct) the chevrons
are made of gold lace braid and the eagle and specialty marks are
embroidered in silver.</p>

<p>The specialty marks indicating the different ranks or “ratings” are, as
shown in the illustrations, as follows:</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF THE<br /> U. S. MARINE CORPS</span></h2></div>

<p>The marines serve both on ship and ashore, while aboard ship their
duties closely approximate those of the sailor in the line of the navy
and while serving ashore their duties are of the same nature as those
of the army soldier, but their uniform is distinctly military in style
and appearance.</p>

<p>Both officers and enlisted men have uniforms of blue cloth
corresponding to those of the navy and worn upon the same occasions,
and the officers have white uniforms to be worn upon the occasions when
officers of the navy wear white, while the enlisted men have no white
uniform coats but wear uniforms of khaki-colored cotton material upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the occasions when enlisted men of the navy wear white. This khaki
uniform is officially known as “summer field” uniform, but commonly
called “khaki.”</p>

<p>Both officers and men are also provided with a “winter field” uniform
for wear upon active service in the field whenever the weather is too
cold for the khaki uniform. The winter field uniforms and the overcoats
for officers and men are made of woolen cloth of a shade known as
“forestry-green,” a grayish olive green.</p>

<p>In time of war the special full dress, full dress and mess dress
uniforms are not worn unless especially ordered for a particular occasion.</p>

<h3>UNIFORMS FOR OFFICERS OF THE MARINE CORPS</h3>

<p>The commissioned officers of the Marine Corps are required to have
complete outfits of special full dress, full dress, undress, white
undress, mess dress, summer field and winter field uniforms.</p>

<p>The warrant officers of the Marine Corps are required to have the same
uniforms with the exception of special full dress, full dress and mess
dress.</p>

<p>The occasions upon which these uniforms are worn are given in the table
of occasions for uniforms for officers of the Navy and Marine Corps,
page 109, and the composition of the various uniforms is as follows:</p>

<p class="space-below2"><i>Special Full Dress Uniform.</i>—For officers of
the Line, a double-breasted frock coat of dark blue cloth, extending
to about one foot below the waist, with two rows of gilt Marine Corps
buttons down the front from the line of the collar to the waist, the
buttons being arranged in groups of threes for the rank of Major
General Commandant, in groups of twos for the rank of Brigadier
General and equally spaced for all other ranks; with a standing collar
embroidered with gold oak leaves for general officers and covered with
gold lace braid for other ranks, the cuffs bearing ornamentations of
gold embroidery to indicate the rank of the wearer (<a href="#USMC">see illustrations
at page 155</a>), the cuffs for general officers being of dark blue velvet;
dark blue cloth trousers, trimmed down the outer leg seams with one
and a quarter inch wide gold lace braid having a quarter inch scarlet
silk stripe through the center; a bell-crowned cap of dark blue cloth
with a sloping visor with a gold chin strap above it and the silver
and gold Marine Corps device at the center of the front of the crown,
gold epaulets, black shoes, white gloves, and the Marine Corps sword
suspended from a belt by slings, belt and slings covered with gold lace braid.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
For officers of the Staff, the same as for officers of the Line except
that the coat is single-breasted with one row of buttons and gold
shoulder knots are worn instead of epaulets, and aiguilettes of plaited
gold cord are worn.</p>

<p>For the Major General Commandant, and officers of the Staff, there
may be worn with this uniform a chapeau or “cocked hat” of black silk
beaver with a two-inch strap of gold lace on the right side upon which
is the silver and gold Marine Corps device and a plume of cock’s
feathers extending over the top of the crown from front to rear, the
plume to be canary-yellow for the Major General Commandant and scarlet
for officers of the Staff.</p>

<p>The Major General Commandant also wears with this uniform a sash of
buff silk with bullion tassels diagonally across the body from the
right shoulder to the waist at the left side, the tassels hanging below
the belt.</p>

<p>Brigadier Generals wear with this uniform a sash belt with a bow at the
left side, of two and a half inch gold lace with a three-eighths inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
scarlet stripe through the center, from which the sword is suspended by
gold lace trimmed slings.</p>

<p>When mounted, officers wear full dress breeches and black boots with
this uniform.</p>

<p>The full dress cap for the Major General Commandant has a band of
blue-black velvet decorated with gold embroidered oak leaves, and a
wreath of oak leaves around the Marine Corps device.</p>

<h3>INSIGNIA OF RANK, CORPS<br /> AND STAFF DEPARTMENTS</h3>

It may be noted that the design of the sleeve ornaments for Field
officers (Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels and Majors) is in the form of
a chevron, while that for company officers (Captains, and First and
Second Lieutenants) is a knot known to seamen as a “carrick bend,” to
artillerymen as a “prolong knot”; and to the civilian as the “True love
knot” representing faithfulness on account of the fact that it does not
readily slip or pull apart. It was on this account that this particular
form of knot was first used as a military emblem to denote faithfulness
or loyalty.</p>

<p>The fact that an officer belongs to the Marine Corps is shown by the
Marine Corps device or insignia worn upon the front of all caps and
field hats, upon the right side of the chapeau, on the top of epaulets
and shoulder knots, and upon the collars of the blue and white undress
coats, summer and winter field coats and mess jackets.</p>

<p>The Marine Corps device for full dress and undress caps is a fretted
silver Western Hemisphere with chased parallels and the continents of
North and South America in gold, resting upon a foul anchor in gold,
and surmounted by a spread eagle of silver. The shank of the anchor is
set at an angle of thirty degrees from the horizontal. The dimensions
are, diameter of hemisphere seven-eighths of an inch, height of eagle
one-half of an inch, length of anchor one and three-quarter inches. The
Corps device worn on epaulets and shoulder knots is of the same size
and design but is made entirely of silver. The Marine Corps devices
worn on the field hat and on the summer field and winter field caps are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the same design and size as those worn on the undress caps but are
made entirely of bronze metal.</p>

<p>The Corps devices worn on the collars of the blue undress coat, white
undress coat and white mess jacket are of silver and gold and of the
same design as those worn on caps but of only three-fourths the size.
Those worn on the collars of the summer field and winter field coats
are of the same design and size as those worn on the undress coats but
are made entirely of dull finish bronze metal.</p>

<p>The aides-de-camp on the personal staff of a General officer wear
a distinctive device consisting of a shield of the United States
three-quarters of an inch high surmounted by an eagle one-half of an
inch high. This device is worn in the center of the sleeve ornament of
the full dress coat and mess jacket and on the collars of the undress
and field coats and white mess jackets in rear of the corps devices,
and on the shoulder straps of the overcoat. For the full dress, undress
and mess dress uniforms the device has the shield in enamel of proper
colors, stripes of red and white, field blue with gold stars indicating
the rank of the general officer on whose staff the aide-de-camp is
serving, two stars for Major General and one star for Brigadier
General. For the field coats and the overcoat the device is of the same
design but made of dull finish bronze metal.</p>

<p>In order to designate the different departments to which the officers
of the Staff of the Marine Corps belong distinctive Departmental
Devices are provided to be worn with all uniforms.</p>

<p><i>Adjutant and Inspector’s Department.</i>—The distinctive device for
this department consists of a miniature Marine Corps sword and fasces
crossed in gold surmounted by a wreath in silver, in the center of
which is a shield of thirteen bars of red and white enamel with the
field in blue enamel containing one large and twelve small gold stars;
the dimensions being, length of sword and fasces one and three-eighths
inches, diameter of wreath three-quarters of an inch.</p>

musicians and of gold cord for the second leader; trousers and cap the

are the same as those worn by other enlisted men of the Marine Corps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

Marine Corps on active duty is required to wear an identification tag,
which consists of a round plate of white metal, one and three-eighths
of an inch in diameter, suspended from the neck by a monel metal wire
encased in a cotton covering.</p>

<p>These tags are stamped as follows; for officers, full name and rank;
enlisted men, full name and date of first enlistment in the Marine
Corps. The tags for both officers and men also have the letters “U. S.
M. C.” plainly stamped upon them.</p>

Coast Guard are very similar to those of the Navy, and they are made
of dark blue cloth for wear in cold or temperate weather and of white
duck for wear in the tropics or in hot weather. A variation from this
general rule is found in the case of the Keepers and surfmen on duty
at the Life-Saving Stations who have uniforms of khaki or olive-drab
cotton duck instead of the white uniforms of the seagoing men of the
Coast Guard.</p>

AND U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY</span></h2></div>

<p>The United States Lighthouse Service is administered under the
Department of Commerce and consists of three divisions; first, the
officers and crews of the lighthouse tenders; second, the officers and
crews of the lightships; and third, the keepers of the lighthouses and
depots on shore.</p>

<p>The lighthouse tenders are steamers which plant and maintain all of the
buoys which mark the channels and courses for ships of various sizes in
the navigable waters of the United States, including the bays, harbors,
lakes and navigable rivers. The lighthouse tenders also carry supplies
to the lightships and many of the shore lighthouses.</p>

<p>Lightships are vessels carrying powerful lights anchored in places
where it is necessary to have lights to aid in the navigation of
seagoing craft but where it would be impossible or impracticable to
build lighthouses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The Depots of the Lighthouse Service are shore establishments where
buoys, lights and lightships may be overhauled and repaired and where
supplies may be kept in stock.</p>

<h3>UNIFORMS OF OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN<br /> OF LIGHTHOUSE TENDERS</h3>

<p>The officers are provided with a blue uniform for cold and temperate
weather and a white uniform for hot weather.</p>

<p>The blue uniform consists of a single-breasted sack coat of navy blue
cloth extending to about ten inches below the waist, with a standing
collar, buttoning down the front by buttons concealed under a fly, the
collar, front and bottom edges being trimmed with black mohair braid
one and one-quarter inches wide; plain trousers of dark blue cloth;
and a cap of navy blue cloth with a sloping visor of patent leather, a
band of black mohair braid one and one-half inches wide, a chin strap
of one-half inch gold braid secured above the visor by means of a small
gilt button at each end of the visor. The insignia of the Lighthouse
Service, a lighthouse, are embroidered in silver on the front of the
cap, surrounded by a wreath embroidered in gold.</p>

<p>The rank of the officer is indicated by stripes of black mohair braid
around the sleeves, the number and width of the stripes for the
different grades being as follows:</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i>—Four stripes, the two outer ones one-half inch and the
two inner ones one-quarter inch wide.</p>

<p><i>Chief Engineer.</i>—Three stripes, the two outer ones one-half inch and
the inner one one-quarter inch wide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Master of Tender.</i>—Four stripes one-quarter of an inch wide.</p>

<p><i>First Officer and Engineer of Tender.</i>—Three stripes one-quarter of an inch wide.</p>

<p><i>First Officer and First Assistant Engineer of Tender.</i>—Two stripes one-quarter inch wide.</p>

<p><i>Third Officer and Second Assistant Engineer of Tender.</i>—One stripe one-quarter inch wide.</p>

<p>Insignia indicating the department to which an officer belongs are
worn on each side of the collar, a gold anchor for deck officers
(corresponding to Line officers in the Navy) and a gold three-bladed
propeller for Engineer Officers.</p>

<p>The white uniform is similar in style and design to the blue uniform,
the braid being white and the insignia on the coat collar of gilt metal.</p>

<p><i>The Overcoat for Officers</i> is double-breasted, made of dark blue
cloth, extending to three inches below the knee, with two rows of black
flat buttons down the front, six in each row and a wide rolling collar.
It bears no stripes or insignia.</p>

<p>Quartermasters and machinists wear a blue uniform consisting of a
double-breasted sack coat of dark blue cloth, with five gilt buttons on
each side, turn-down collar and lapels, two side pockets with flaps;
plain dark blue cloth trousers; and a cap of the same pattern as that
worn by officers, but having a black patent leather chin strap, and the
letters “U. S. L. H. S.” embroidered in gold around the base of the
silver lighthouse insignia instead of the gold wreath on the front of
the officers’ cap.</p>

<p>The insignia indicating the rank, worn on each sleeve midway between
the shoulder seam and the elbow, consist of a ship’s steering wheel
embroidered in white for quartermaster and a three-bladed propeller
embroidered in red for machinist.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br /><span class="h_subtitle">UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF<br /> THE U. S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE</span></h2></div>

<p>The U. S. Public Health Service, operated as a Bureau of the Department
of the Treasury, has charge of the enforcement of the quarantine
regulations for the prevention of the introduction of contagious and
infectious diseases into the United States from abroad or from one
state or territory to another; the care of sick and disabled seamen
of the merchant marine, and of scientific research at home and abroad
regarding diseases of man which may affect the general public health
and welfare.</p>

<p>This service was formerly known as the Public Health and Marine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Hospital Service, but by an Act of Congress dated August 14, 1912, the
name of the service was changed to the Public Health Service and its
duties were increased and its powers and responsibilities much enlarged.</p>

<p>The Public Health Service is administered under a Surgeon General
stationed at the National Capital, the various duties being assigned to
seven divisions.</p>

<p>The Division of Scientific Research, as its name implies, is charged
with studies of various diseases such as typhoid, malarial, typhus and
yellow fevers, leprosy, tuberculosis, trachoma, pellagra, sanitation
and hygiene, water supply and sewage and public health administration
in states and cities in cooperation with the local authorities. This
division conducts a Hygienic Laboratory at Washington and a number
of field laboratories where intensive studies in these subjects are
conducted. Through this division the Surgeon General of the Service
enforces the laws for the regulation of the sale of viruses and serums
and calls annual and special conferences of the health authorities of
the several states and territories for the purpose of cooperation in
the suppression of preventable diseases and the general improvement of
the public health.</p>

<p>The Division of Foreign and Insular Quarantine and Immigration is
charged with the execution of the national quarantine laws, this being
accomplished at fifty Federal Quarantine Stations in the United States,
with additional stations at Panama, Porto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
Hawaii and the Philippines. There are also medical officers under this
division detailed at various Consular stations of the United States
in foreign countries to assist in the prevention of the introduction
of contagious or infectious diseases into the United States or its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
possessions. This division also conducts the physical and mental
examinations of all aliens entering the territory of the United States
at any of its ports.</p>

<p>The Division of Domestic and Interstate Quarantine has charge of the
enforcement of the laws for the prevention of the spread of contagious
or infectious diseases from one state or territory to another.</p>

<p>The Division of Sanitary Reports and Statistics has cognizance of the
collection and publication of information relative to the diseases which
may threaten the public health of the United States and foreign countries.</p>

<p>The Division of Marine Hospitals has charge of twenty-two Marine
Hospitals and about one hundred and twenty-five smaller relief stations
at the different ports and cities of the country.</p>

<p>At these stations and hospitals the sick and disabled officers and
seamen of the Coast Guard and Lighthouse Services, the Mississippi
River Commission, the Engineer Corps of the Army at work upon rivers
and harbors works, and the registered and licensed ships of the United
States merchant marine are given necessary medical and surgical
treatment. This division also furnishes the medical officers for the
vessels of the Coast Guard.</p>

<p>The Division of Personnel and Accounts has charge of the record of the
officers and men of the service and of the expenditures of the moneys
appropriated for the service from the public funds.</p>

<p>The Miscellaneous Division issues the various annual reports, public
health reports and other publications of the service, including the bulletins
of the results of research at the Hygienic Laboratory at Washington.</p>

<p>The officers of the Public Health Service have titles corresponding to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
their duties and rank assimilated to that of the Army and Navy, the
different grades being as follows:</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br /><span class="h_subtitle">MEDALS, BADGES AND RIBBONS</span></h2></div>

<p>In all of the nations of the world it is customary to recognize special
acts of gallantry upon the field of battle, marked devotion to duty in
the service of the country and long and faithful service in the armies
and navies by promotion, by granting special honors or orders, or by
the conferring of medals and decorations.</p>

<p>In the military and naval service of the United States there are a
number of authorized medals and badges presented to the officers and
enlisted men in recognition of their gallant services and deeds in the
wars in which our country has been engaged.</p>

<p>In addition to the medals conferred for war service there are medals
for long and faithful service with the colors and special badges
awarded for excellency at target practice both on land and sea.</p>

<p>These medals and badges are proudly worn and highly prized by their
recipients and are often handed down to posterity as valued heirlooms.</p>

<p>Medals and badges are usually suspended from a small section of ribbon,
the colors of the ribbon being distinctive for each medal.</p>

<p>In accordance with the regulations and orders for the various services
medals are to be worn with special full dress and full dress uniforms
on the left breast in one horizontal line, suspended from a single
holding bar, each medal being attached to the bar by the distinctive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
ribbon authorized for it, and the upper edge of the bar being on a
horizontal line one inch below the point of the shoulder, which should
bring it between the first and second buttons of the full dress coat
for officers.</p>

<p>There is a specified order for the arrangement of the medals upon the
holding bar, the medal of the oldest date being worn nearest the center
line of the coat and the others in order of precedence, according to
the date of the event for which conferred, toward the left shoulder of
the wearer.</p>

<p>With undress and service uniforms in lieu of the medals and badges
sections of the ribbons from which they are suspended are worn. These
ribbons of medals and badges are each equal in length to the full width
of the ribbon and three-eighths of an inch wide. Ribbons of medals and
badges are worn on the left breast of the coat in the same relative
position as the medals and badges which they represent. In case the
wearer has received so many that there is not room on the coat to wear
them in one row, they are arranged in two rows.</p>

<p>The medals and badges, or the ribbons worn in their stead with undress
and service uniforms, show the special military honors which have been
conferred upon the wearer and the wars and campaigns in which he has
seen active service, and a knowledge of the designs of these bits of
metal and of the bright colored strips of silk will often give a fair
idea of the services and honors of the man who wears them.</p>

<p>The founders of the United States of America looked askance upon
anything that savored of monarchical government and as a result we find
that the Constitution provides that,</p>

<p class="blockquot">“No title of nobility shall be granted by the
United States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust
under them shall, without the consent of Congress, accept of any
present, emolument, office or title of any kind whatever, from any
king, prince or foreign state.”</p>

     <p class="blockquot2">Bars of distinctive ribbons of United States Government medals.

</div>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Following out this early mandate the regulations of the present day
forbid the <i>wearing</i> by the officers and enlisted men of the services
of the United States of any medal or decoration granted by any foreign
state or ruler, although the Congress has in a number of instances
authorized officers and enlisted men to <i>receive</i> such decorations.</p>

<p>In the early days of the republic Congress on several occasions passed
resolutions of thanks to commanders on land and sea whose forces had
won notable victories, and these resolutions generally provided for the
striking of a medal to commemorate the victory and for a sword of honor
to be presented by the government to the victorious commander, but
these medals were not intended to be worn with the uniform.</p>

<p>It was not until 1861 that Congress authorized the first medal to
be worn as a special badge of honor by soldiers who had especially
distinguished themselves in the military service of the country. This
decoration was officially styled the “Medal of Honor.”</p>

<p>This was followed in later years by the enactment of laws prescribing
other decorations and medals and the promulgation of regulations and
orders as to the manner in which they should be worn.</p>

<p>The following medals and badges are authorized by Act of Congress or by
executive order and in accordance with the regulations of the military
and naval services are worn by the officers and enlisted men upon whom
they have been conferred.

The designs of the various medals and badges and the colors of their
distinctive ribbons are shown in the accompanying illustrations.</p>

<p>Laws have been passed authorizing the wearing of the badges of certain
societies composed of men who have served in the War of the Revolution,
the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the War with Spain,
the Philippine Insurrection and the China Relief Expedition, but the
regulations prohibit the wearing of these badges while in uniform when
medals and badges presented by the government are worn.</p>

<p><i>The Medal of Honor, U. S. Army.</i>—The Medal of Honor for the Army
was first authorized by Act of Congress in 1861 and is awarded to
officers and enlisted men of the Army in the name of Congress for
particular deeds of most distinguished gallantry in action. In order
that an officer or enlisted man may receive a medal of honor he must
have performed in action a deed of most distinguished personal bravery
or self-sacrifice, above and beyond the call of duty, so conspicuous
as to clearly distinguish him for gallantry or intrepidity above his
comrades in arms, involving risk of life or the performance of more
than ordinarily hazardous service. This medal is of bronze with the
wreath in green enamel.</p>

<p><i>The Medal of Honor</i>, U. S. Navy and Marine Corps. The Medal of Honor
for the Navy, including the Marine Corps, was authorized by Act of
Congress in 1862, which provided that enlisted men of the Naval Service
distinguishing themselves in battle, or by extraordinary heroism in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
line of their profession, may be promoted to forward warrant
officers, upon the recommendation of their commanding officer, approved
by the Flag Officer and the Secretary of the Navy; and that upon such
recommendation they shall receive a Medal of Honor and a gratuity of
one hundred dollars. This law provided the medal of honor and its
accompanying gratuity for enlisted men only, but the Act of Congress
of March 3, 1915, extended it to officers by the following proviso:
“The President of the United States is hereby empowered to prepare
a suitable Medal of Honor to be awarded to any officer of the Navy,
Marine Corps, or Coast Guard who shall distinguish himself in battle or
display extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.” The Navy
Medal of Honor and the anchor from which it is suspended are of bronze.</p>

<p>Medals of Honor for both the Army and the Navy, being the highest
decorations awarded by the United States government, are worn suspended
from the neck by a ribbon of light blue studded with white stars so
that the medal will be at the center of the neck opening of the coat.</p>

<p><i>The Medal Commemorating the Battle of Manila Bay.</i>—This medal,
popularly known as the “Dewey Medal,” was the next one authorized by
Congress after the Medal of Honor, and was struck in accordance with a
joint resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives approved by
the President on June 3, 1898, reading as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>,
That the Secretary of the Navy be, and he hereby is, authorized to
present a sword of honor to Commodore George Dewey, and to cause to
be struck bronze medals commemorating the battle of Manilla Bay, and
to distribute such medals to the officers and men of the ships of the
Asiatic Squadron of the United States under command of Commodore George
Dewey on May first, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.”</p>

during the War with Spain.</i>—This medal, usually known to the service
as the “Sampson Medal,” was struck in accordance with a joint
resolution of Congress approved by the President on March 3, 1901,
reading as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>,

to cause to be struck medals commemorative of the naval and other
engagements in the waters of the West Indies and on the shores of

Corps who rendered specially meritorious service, otherwise than in
battle, may be rewarded in a like manner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

representation of a gun’s crew in bas-relief; the medal is suspended by
its distinctive ribbon, red, blue, red, from a bronze bar bearing the

added for each engagement.</p>

<p><i>Special Meritorious Medal for Services in the War with Spain Other
than in Battle.</i>—This medal was struck in accordance with the joint
resolution of Congress of March 3, 1901, quoted above, the portion of

Marine Corps who rendered specially meritorious service, otherwise than
in battle, may be rewarded in like manner.”</p>

wreath and the inscription “U. S. Naval Campaign West Indies,” and the
arms of the cross bear the words “Specially Meritorious Service 1898,”
on the obverse side. On the reverse side is engraved the name of the
recipient and the act for which the medal was awarded.</p>

<p><i>The Certificate of Merit Medal.</i>—This medal is conferred upon

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF<br /> FOREIGN ARMIES AND NAVIES</span></h2></div>

<p>The uniforms and insignia of the armies and navies of foreign powers
present such a great variety in design, style and color as to preclude
the possibility of giving a detailed description of them within the
limits of this book.</p>

<p>However, in order that the rank of the officers and enlisted men of
these foreign services may be readily recognizable under the conditions
that ordinarily prevail on active service ashore or afloat, there is
included in this chapter a short description of the service uniforms
and insignia worn by the officers and enlisted men of the armies and
navies of Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Russia, Germany
and Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the uniforms of the navies of the world bear more
similarity to each other than do those of the armies, thus the rank of
naval officers of all the great powers is indicated by stripes of braid
worn on the sleeves between the elbow and the lower edge of the cuff,
and in most cases by similar stripes or other insignia worn upon straps
placed on the shoulders between the base of the collar and the sleeve
at the shoulder seam.</p>

<p>In the different armies there is much more diversity in design and
color as well as in the method of indicating rank and corps; stripes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and various designs upon the cuffs, insignia and stripes upon shoulder
straps and insignia of many different designs upon the collar being the
most common means.</p>

<p>In one respect all of the naval and military services of the world
follow the same custom, medals and decorations awarded for especial
deeds of gallantry, for long and faithful service or to commemorate
some special event in war or peace are worn upon the left breast with
dress uniforms, almost always suspended from a ribbon of distinctive
color design, while a small section of this distinctive ribbon is
worn with undress uniform and service uniforms. As a special mark of
distinction the medals considered the highest in rank are frequently worn
on the right breast or suspended from a ribbon or chain around the neck.</p>

<p>A marked tendency toward simplification in design both of uniform and
insignia and toward the use of neutral or dull colors is also evident
in recent years. This is largely due to the necessity of making the
soldier as inconspicuous as possible when on the firing line, but also
to the great expense incurred in fitting out very large forces of men
in elaborate dress uniforms for which there is no use in the field.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it may be expected that when the world returns to a basis
of general peace time conditions the dress uniforms and bright insignia
and buttons that add so much to the brilliancy of military gatherings
will again be in evidence; especially since there is so much of the
tradition of the past associated with these uniforms and badges of rank
and corps.</p>

<p>Attractive uniforms induce a corresponding pride in the smartness
and neatness of the soldier or sailor and the distinctive badges of
regiments and corps with long histories of creditable achievement go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
far to establish the <i>esprit de corps</i> which so surely makes for
efficiency and contentment.</p>

<h3>UNIFORMS OF THE BRITISH NAVY</h3>

<p>In Great Britain the Navy is known as “The Senior Service” as it was
organized as a regular service prior to the organization of a regular
national Army.</p>

<p>In general the uniforms of the British Navy correspond quite closely to
those of the United State Navy in composition and design and are worn
upon similar occasions, although they are somewhat more elaborate, but
the insignia are of different design.</p>

<p>Commissioned officers must provide themselves with full dress, ball
dress, frock coat dress, blue mess dress, white mess dress, blue
undress and white undress.</p>

<p>The full dress is very nearly the same in style and design to the
special full dress of the United States naval officer, the ball dress
is practically the same as the evening dress of the United States naval
officer and the frock coat dress and blue and white mess dress the same
as the corresponding United States naval uniforms. The blue undress
uniform of the British naval officer differs from the service dress
of the United States naval officer in that the coat worn with it is a
square cut, double-breasted sack coat with turn-down collar and rolling
lapels with two rows of four buttons each down the front. The white
undress of the British officer is the same as the white service dress
of the American officer.</p>

<p>The rank of British naval officers is shown by insignia of rank on the
tops of the epaulets with uniforms with which epaulets are worn, but
with all of the blue uniforms the rank is also indicated by stripes
of gold lace braid around the sleeves of the coat above the cuff.
The number and arrangements of these rank stripes are shown in the
accompanying illustration.</p>

With the white mess dress and the white undress the rank is indicated
by the stripes of gold braid or by other insignia of rank worn upon the
shoulder straps. These shoulder straps are also worn with the great
coat. There are no sleeve stripes on the white coats or the great coat.</p>

<p>The insignia of rank used on the shoulder straps of Flag Officers
and the stripes indicating rank used on the shoulder straps of
officers below the rank of Flag Officer are shown in the accompanying
illustrations.</p>

<p>The Corps or Branch of the service to which an officer belongs is shown
as follows on the sleeves and shoulder straps:—</p>

<table class="space-above2" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

      <td class="tdl_top">Accountant or Pay Officers</td>

</table>

<p>It will thus be seen that the system of stripes on the sleeves and
shoulder straps to indicate rank is practically the same in the British
and United States navies, the “curl” in the British navy being used for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the same purpose as the gold star in the United States navy, that is,
to show that the officer wearing it belongs to the Line, or the command
branch of the service.</p>

<p>The officers’ overcoat or “great coat” in the British navy is a double
breasted coat of ulster style reaching to just below the knees. It has
a rolling collar with notched lapels and is closed by two rows of gilt
service buttons down the front and has shoulder straps to indicate
the rank of the wearer but no stripes on the sleeves. In the back the
fulness is held in by a strap secured by two gilt buttons.</p>

<p>The service buttons of the British navy bear a raised design of a
vertical foul anchor surmounted by a royal crown, the edge being
surrounded by a raised rope design.</p>

<p>The caps and cocked hats of the British Navy are similar to those worn
by United States naval officers except that there is more bell to
the crown of the British cap. The cap insignia worn by commissioned
officers are embroidered on the front of the cap and consist of a
vertical foul anchor surrounded by a gilt wreath and surmounted by a
royal crown in gilt and scarlet; the anchor being silver in the case of
officers of the Line and gilt for officers of the Staff Corps.</p>

<p>The sword worn by British naval officers is much the same in general
appearance as that worn by American officers, the differences being
in the carved designs upon the hilt and blade of the sword and upon
the bands of the scabbard. This is due to the fact that the American
sword like the other parts of the American naval uniform was originally
adopted from the British Navy.</p>

The officers of the British Naval Air Service wear as a distinguishing
mark of their service a gilt spread eagle on each sleeve above the rank
stripes and a silver spread eagle in the center of the cap insignia in
place of the anchor worn there by other officers. Their service buttons
also have the spread eagle in place of the anchor for other officers.</p>

<p>Officers of the Royal Naval Division detailed for duty on shore wear a
uniform of khaki-colored cloth similar in design to the service uniform
of British Army officers; their sleeves bearing the rank stripes of the
same widths, number and arrangement as for other naval officers but
made of braid of a slightly different shade than the material of the
coat, and their shoulder straps bearing the same insignia of rank as
that worn by the corresponding grades in the army.</p>

<p>Officers of the British Royal Naval Reserve wear the same uniforms
as those prescribed for officers of the regular service, except that
the stripes on the cuffs and on the shoulder straps while of the same
number for the different grades are of a different design. The design
of these stripes represents a rope twisted of two strands and in place
of the “curl” above the upper stripe to indicate officers of the line
there is a star shaped design made up of two interlocked triangles of
narrow gold braid. The corps or branch of Staff officers of the Royal
Naval Reserve is indicated by stripes of cloth between the twisted
strand stripes, the distinctive colors for the different corps or
branches being the same for Staff officers of the regular navy.</p>

<p>Officers of the British Naval Volunteer Reserve wear the same
uniforms as those prescribed for the officers of the regular naval
establishment, except that the stripes on the sleeves and shoulder
straps to indicate rank, while being of the same number and arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
for the different grades, are laid on in waving lines instead of in
straight lines as in the case of the regular officers. The distinctive
color stripes to indicate the various corps or branches for Staff
Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve are the same as for the
regular service.</p>

<p>Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve and of the Royal Naval Volunteer
Reserve attached to the Royal Naval Air Service wear their respective
uniforms with the addition of the spread eagle design above the rank
stripes on the sleeves and shoulder straps.</p>

<p>Officers of the British Colonial Naval Establishments maintained by the
greater colonial divisions of the British Empire wear distinctive marks
to indicate their especial service. These naval establishments comprise
the Royal Indian Marine, the Australian Navy and the Canadian.</p>

<p>The enlisted men of the British Navy wear uniforms very similar in
general design to those worn in the United States Navy with minor
differences in the dimensions and cut of the various garments. The
Chief Petty Officers wear uniforms of blue or white consisting of a
bell-crowned cap with a black mohair band, a black patent leather
visor and insignia consisting of two concentric circles surrounding a
vertical foul anchor surmounted by a British crown; a double-breasted
sack coat with two rows of gilt service buttons; and plain trousers.
Other petty officers and seamen wear the sailor cap, wide collared
shirt and bell-mouthed trousers common to the American service, the
collar having three rows of narrow white braid around the edges with
a black neckerchief knotted beneath it. The three rows of braid
commemorate Nelson’s three great victories—Copenhagen, the Nile and
Trafalgar—and the black neckerchief was first worn as a badge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
mourning for this great sea fighter. The cap has a black silk ribbon
around the band upon which is the name of the ship in gilt block
letters, thus,</p>

<p class="f120">H. M. S. DREADNOUGHT</p>

<p class="no-indent">the letters H.M.S. being the abbreviation of “His Majesty’s Ship.”</p>

<p>Rating badges to indicate the rank or rating of petty officers and men
on special duties are worn on the sleeves between the shoulder seam and
the elbow and are very numerous and complex, some of the principal ones
being, in red,</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the British Royal Marines</span></h3>

<p>The Royal Marines perform duties similar to those performed by the
United States Marines both afloat and ashore and hold a high record for
efficiency and loyalty. They are divided into two branches, the Royal
Marine Artillery and the Royal Marine Light Infantry, the former being
popularly known as the “Blue Marines” on account of the fact that their
dress coats are of blue cloth and the latter as the “Red Marines” since
their dress coats are of red cloth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>Both branches are also provided with khaki-colored uniforms for field
service ashore.</p>

<p>The rank of the officers is indicated by insignia of rank worn on the
shoulder straps, these insignia being the same for the various ranks as
those worn by officers of the British Army.</p>

<p>The titles for the different grades of rank of the officers are the
same as those for the British Army, namely, General, Lieutenant
General, Major General, Brigadier General, Colonel, Major, Captain,
Lieutenant and Second Lieutenant.</p>

<p>The ranks of the enlisted men are indicated by badges or chevrons worn
upon the sleeves between the shoulder seam and the elbow, as follows:</p>

The Corps insignia of the Royal Marines are the eastern hemisphere
in silver surrounded by a gold laurel wreath, the insignia being
surmounted by two gold cannon crossed for the Marine Artillery and by
gold bugle trumpet for the Marine Light Infantry. These insignia are
commonly referred to in the British service as “The Globe and Laurel.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the British Army</span></h3>

<p>At the beginning of the present world war the Land Forces of the
British Empire embraced the regular troops commonly known as the
“Home Army” and the troops of her far-flung colonial possessions
and dependencies, such as the Indian Army, the Australian Army, the
Canadian Army, the South African Forces, the West Indian regiments,
the New Zealand troops, and the Police and Constabulary troops of many
minor colonies and possessions.</p>

<p>In the “Home Army” there were many varieties and colors in the uniforms
and when we add to this the distinctive uniforms of the various
Colonial Forces and the picturesque native uniforms of the Indian
forces the resultant assemblage is one which would require many volumes
to adequately describe.</p>

<p>In one respect however the clothing of the various units collected from
all over the vast British Empire to make up the great “New Army” of
Great Britain is practically the same,—the service or field uniform of
all is cut on the same lines and the insignia of rank worn with this
uniform are the same for all, the variations being in the corps and
regimental badges which indicate the portion of the empire from which
the regiments come and the arm of the service in which they are serving.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>The British were the first to adopt the neutral brown shade known as
“khaki” for their field or service uniforms and its practicability and
serviceability became so evident to them that its use was extended to
all of their armed land forces, with the result that they now have a
uniform and equipment which for serviceability, efficiency, comfort and
smartness of appearance is excelled by no other nation.</p>

<p>The British Army officers’ uniform is made of a standard dark khaki
colored cloth or serge and consists of a single-breasted coat with
turn-down collar and rolling notched lapels, closed in front by a row
of four gilt buttons, cut to fit snugly at the waist, easy across the
breast and shoulders and with enough flare to the skirt to make it hang
well over the full breeches that are worn with it; breeches which lace
below the knee; tan leather strap puttees and shoes or tan leather
boots; a bell-crowned cap with a sharply sloping visor; and the “Sam
Browne” sword and pistol belt. Wrap puttees of khaki-colored cloth are
also worn for garrison and field service.</p>

<p>The coat has a pleated patch pocket on each breast closed by a buttoned
flap, and a large bellows patch pocket on each side below the waist
which is also closed by a buttoned flap, and cloth shoulder straps on
each shoulder secured by a small button at the collar end.</p>

The rank of an officer in service uniform is indicated by metal
insignia of rank worn upon the shoulder straps and also (for officers
below the rank of Brigadier General) by stripes of worsted braid
around the sleeves just above the lower edge and by worsted insignia
of rank worn on a three-pointed strap which crosses the sleeve stripes
on the cuffs. These insignia of rank are shown in the accompanying

<p class="space-above2">The officers of the Scottish and Highland
regiments wear the stripes on the cuffs in a curve from the outer edge
of the sleeve to a higher point at the inner edge of the sleeve and the
insignia of rank beneath these stripes in a horizontal line instead
of in a vertical line as described and illustrated for the other officers.</p>

<p>The wearing of the insignia of rank upon the shoulder straps except by
officers of the rank of Brigadier General and higher has been suspended
when on actual duty in the field.</p>

<p>The insignia worn upon the front of the cap by a Field Marshal consists
of two crossed batons in red surrounded by a gold wreath and surmounted
by a gold and red crown above which is a gold British lion; for General
officers it is the same except that instead of the two batons there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
one baton and a sword crossed; permanent Staff officers wear the crown
and lion only on the cap; and a Field Marshal, General officers and
permanent Staff officers of field rank or above wear a scarlet band
around the cap.</p>

<p>For regimental officers the insignia worn on the front of the cap are
the distinctive “Regimental badges” adopted for the regiment. These
regimental badges present a great variety in design and often refer to
some historic battle in which the regiment has taken part or to some
distinctive feature of the county or colony from which the regiment comes.</p>

<p>In many cases the name by which the regiment is commonly known is
contained in the design, in others the number of the regiment in its
corps is given in the design, and not infrequently the regimental motto
has a prominent place.</p>

<p>Thus the regimental badge of the 4th Hussars, a famous cavalry
regiment, is a gold circle bearing the inscription “Queen’s Own
Hussars,” surmounted by a gold crown, and having on the center the
number of the regiment “IV,” and on a scroll beneath the motto “Mente
et Manu.”</p>

<p>The Irish Rifles have the Irish harp surmounted by a royal crown with a
scroll beneath bearing the motto “Quis Separabit,” all in green enamel.</p>

<p>The 17th Lancers have as their insignia a skull and cross bones with
the words “or Glory” on a scroll beneath, the motto of the regiment
being “Death or Glory.”</p>

<p>The 12th Canadian Infantry has a gold maple leaf bearing the number of
the regiment in silver and the word “Canada” also in silver.</p>

<p>The Grenadier Guards regiments have a gold spherical bursting shell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Chaplains wear a Maltese cross surmounted by a crown in black enamel.</p>

<p>Officers of the Army Pay Corps wear the monogram “A.P.C.” surmounted by
a crown.</p>

<p>The insignia of the Royal Army Medical Corps consist of the rod of
Esculapius with a single serpent entwined about it surrounded by a
wreath and surmounted by a crown with the scroll beneath bearing the
inscription “Royal Army Medical Corps,” all in gold.</p>

<p>Both officers and enlisted men in the British Army habitually wear gilt
buttons and insignia on their service khaki-colored uniforms, although
when in the field these buttons and insignia are allowed to tarnish or
bronze, and in many cases leather buttons are used on field service in
place of the gilt buttons.</p>

<p>The overcoat, or great coat, worn by the officers of the British Army
is a double-breasted ulster quite similar in design to that worn by
officers of the United States Army, but having a lapel collar and
reaching only to the knee. It is made of cloth of the same color as the
service uniform and has shoulder straps upon which the insignia of rank
are worn.</p>

<p>The service uniform of the enlisted men of the British Army is of the
same khaki-colored cloth as the officers’ uniform and consists of a
cap similar to that worn by officers with a visor of tan leather or of
khaki-colored cloth upon the front of which the regimental or corps
insignia are worn; a single-breasted sack coat buttoning to the neck
with a standing turn-over collar, a patch pocket on each breast and a
bellows patch pocket on each side below the waist, and shoulder straps
upon which are worn, near the arm seam, the regimental badges; breeches
of the same color as the coat; wrap khaki-colored cloth puttees; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
heavy tan leather laced shoes. The overcoat is a short double-breasted
coat with rolling collar and back straps.</p>

<p>In hot weather khaki cotton drill uniforms of the same design are worn.</p>

<p>As variations of this general uniform, the Scottish and Highland troops
still wear the kilts as their winter uniform, although in hot weather
they also wear the full khaki summer uniform, the troops from Australia
and Canada to a great extent wear the wide brimmed felt hat common in
the American service, and the Indian troops wear their native turbans
and trousers although these are of the standard khaki color.</p>

<p>The rank of the noncommissioned officers is indicated in the British
Armies by badges worn upon the sleeves between the elbow and the
shoulder, as in the United States Army, many of these insignia being
nearly the same for the various grades, doubtless due to the fact that
the American insignia were originally taken from the British during the
revolutionary period.</p>

<p>The principal insignia of rank worn on the sleeves of noncommissioned
officers and enlisted men holding special assignments of duty are as
follows:</p>

<p>A new type of distinguishing mark adopted during the present war
consists of pieces of cloth of various shapes worn in the center of
the back between the shoulders to enable officers to distinguish the
organization to which a man on the firing line belongs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the French Army</span></h3>

<p>Up to within a few years the uniform of the troops of the Line of the
French Army consisted of a dark blue coat and red trousers, with caps
of the <i>kepi</i> design and white gaiters or short leggings. This uniform
was decorated with gold and silver ornamentation and rank insignia and
as a variation in the headdress the cavalry wore helmets with plumes.</p>

<p>At the time of the Boer War in South Africa the question of a less
conspicuous uniform was agitated with the result that a coat of
mignonette green (or <i>reseda</i> as it was called in France) was adopted
although the red trousers were retained. With this uniform a helmet
of the same color as the coat was adopted. Some of the troops still
retained the dark blue coats however and discussion as to the uniform
to be finally adopted continued.</p>

<p>In 1912 a single-breasted sack coat of a light gray-blue color was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
tried with the blue and red <i>kepi</i>, and red trousers which were worn
tight around the calves of the legs. The wrap puttee was also worn to
some extent.</p>

<p>Shortly after the beginning of the present war it was demonstrated by
service in the field that the red trousers and gold trimmings were too
conspicuous for modern field service, and as a result a uniform of
the light gray-blue color, known as “horizon blue,” was adopted for
both officers and enlisted men on field service, but the old dress
uniforms were not abolished though not worn during war. In this uniform
simplicity was sought and all bright buttons, insignia and trimmings
were reduced to a minimum with the object of securing a serviceable and
inconspicuous uniform.</p>

<p>The officers’ service uniform consists of a single-breasted sack coat
with a standing turn-down collar, shoulder straps and four outside
patch pockets similar to the service coat of United States Army
officers; breeches; tan leather strap puttees and shoes, or tan leather
boots, and a cap (<i>kepi</i>) of the same color as the coat and trousers.
The color of this uniform is a light blue-gray. The buttons are of
silver-bronze.</p>

<p>The cap, or <i>kepi</i>, has a sloping visor of black patent leather with
a band covered with gold lace for general officers and of distinctive
colored cloth with narrow gold stripes indicating rank for other
officers, and the top of the crown is slightly less in diameter than
the band. In the case of general officers the visor is ornamented with
gold decorations.</p>

<p>In the trenches when under fire a steel helmet is worn as a protection
against long range rifle bullets and pieces of shrapnel. This helmet is
of the same color as the service uniform and it has a distinctive corps
insignia on the front in metal of the same color.</p>

When on duty away from the actual battle front the dress cap of red or
blue (according to the corps) is frequently worn.</p>

<p>The rank of officers in the French Army was formerly indicated by stars
on the cuffs for General officers and by gold or silver stripes around
the cuffs of the coats for other officers, the widths, number and
arrangement of the stripes being practically the same as those worn by
officers of the same relative rank in the navy. These stripes proved
too conspicuous for field service and a small section of the stripes
showing on the front of the sleeve only was adopted for the service
coats. These short stripes or <i>galons</i> are of dull gold or silver
depending on the rank and are as shown in the accompanying illustration.</p>

<p>The insignia for the different grades of rank are as follows:</p>

The corps or branch of the service is indicated in the French Army by
distinctive insignia or color patches worn on the collar at the front
on both sides of the neck opening.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the French Army uniforms for both the officers
and enlisted men is the “war service chevrons” worn on the right sleeve
between the elbow and the shoulder with the point of the chevron up. A
chevron of one stripe shows that the wearer has had one year’s active
service at the front during the present war and an additional stripe is
added to the chevron for each additional period of six months service
at the front. These service chevrons are of dull gold.</p>

<p>Officers of the Algerian Corps and of the Colonial Infanterie wear
winter service uniforms of khaki-colored cloth and hot weather uniforms
of khaki cotton material; the design of the garments being the same as
for those of the home troops except that the Algerians wear very loose
baggy trousers cut after the “Zouave” style.</p>

<p>Officers in the Aviation service also wear khaki-colored uniforms.</p>

<p>The officers’ overcoat is single-breasted reaching to about three
inches below the knees, closed with a single row of bronze buttons down
the center of the front, buttoning to the neck, with a wide falling
collar, and a large pocket on each side. Like the enlisted men’s
overcoat it is fitted to have the fronts of the skirt button back to
permit freedom of the legs in marching. The same stripes indicating
rank are worn upon the sleeves as upon the service coat.</p>

<p>In the French Army there is a rank called “Adjutant” which corresponds
to that of Warrant officer in the United States Navy and Marine Corps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
but for which there is no corresponding rank in the United States Army.
His service uniform is similar to that worn by commissioned officers;
his cap bears no rank stripes, and his rank is indicated by a narrow
gold cuff stripe broken with sections of black.</p>

<p>The sword belt for officers is of tan leather with a cross strap over
the right shoulder and diagonally to the left side above the hip, very
similar to the British “Sam Browne” belt. It is worn by officers at all
times when on duty in service uniform.</p>

<p>The enlisted men of the French Army have service uniforms of the same
color as those for officers. The uniform consists of a single-breasted
sack coat, with standing collar and a patch pocket with buttoned flap
on each side below the waist, cut to fit easily; breeches cut full
above and close fitting below the knees; wrap puttees of cloth of the
same color as the coat and breeches; tan leather shoes; and a plain cap
of the kepi pattern with sloping visor.</p>

<p>The Algerian troops wear uniforms of the same design but of
khaki-colored cloth and very loose “Zouave” style breeches.</p>

<p>The Colonial Infantry wear service uniforms of the same design as those
for the home troops but of khaki-colored material.</p>

<p>Mounted troops and field artillery wear tan leather boots or tan
leather leggings and shoes.</p>

<p>The overcoat for enlisted men is single-breasted, reaching a little
below the knee, with side pockets, and fitted to have the skirts
buttoned back from the front so as not to interfere with the freedom of
the legs in marching. The overcoats are of the light blue-gray cloth.</p>

<p>The rank of noncommissioned officers is indicated by short stripes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
cloth worn diagonally across the outer side of the coat sleeves between
the elbow and the lower edge, as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above2">The arm of the service to which an enlisted
man belongs is shown by color patches upon the collar on both sides of
the front opening. These patches are of yellow for infantry, blue for
cavalry, red for artillery and black for engineers, and have the number
of the regiment upon them in black figures for infantry, white for
cavalry and artillery, and red for engineers. Aviators wear an insignia
consisting of two eagle’s wings upon each side of the collar.</p>

<p>The belts, belt suspender straps and cartridge boxes are of tan
leather, though webbing is also in use. The water bottle (canteen) is
covered with cloth of the same color as the uniform.</p>

<p>The buttons worn by enlisted men upon the service uniform coat and
overcoat are plain and of the same color as the material of the coats.</p>

<p>In some special corps of the French service there are variations from
the standard uniform above described, thus the Chasseurs Alpin wear a
uniform of dark blue cloth with a dark blue <i>beret</i>, a full-crowned
visorless hat something after the style of the tam-o-shanter, and the
Algerian troops wear a round turban of khaki-colored cloth with a
tassel in the center, after the style of the fez.

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the French Navy</span></h3>

<p>The uniforms of the officers and men of the French Navy, while
following in general the usual naval style present some variations
as to the combination of garments, the decorations, the number and
arrangements of the rank stripes on the sleeves and the designs of the
insignia of rank and corps.</p>

<p>Commissioned officers are provided with five separate uniforms, full
dress, No. 1 dress, No. 2 dress, No. 3 dress blue, and No. 3 dress white.</p>

<p>The full dress corresponds to the United States naval officer’s special
full dress uniform, and consists of a cocked hat, a dark blue double
breasted cutaway frock coat, gilt epaulets, dark blue cloth trousers
decorated with gold lace stripes down the outer seams.</p>

<p>No. 1 dress corresponds to the United States naval officer’s full dress
uniform and consists of a cocked hat, blue cap or white cap, a dark
blue double-breasted frock coat with epaulets, and plain dark blue or
white trousers.</p>

<p>No. 2 dress corresponds to the undress uniform of the United States
naval officer and consists of the blue or white cap, the dark blue
frock coat or the white tunic and dark blue or white trousers.</p>

<p>No. 3 dress, blue, corresponds to the blue service dress of the United
States naval officer and consists of the dark blue cap, dark blue frock
coat or dark blue tunic (sack coat) and dark blue or white trousers.</p>

<p>No. 3 dress, white, corresponds to the white service dress of the
United States naval officer and consists of the white cap, white tunic
and white trousers.</p>

<p>Black shoes are worn with all except white uniforms, with which white
shoes are worn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
The rank of commissioned officers is shown by means of insignia on the
tops of the epaulets, with uniforms of which epaulets form a part,
and by decorations on the cuffs of the sleeves of the frock coat
and service sack coat. These sleeve decorations are as shown by the
illustrations:—</p>

The cap for Flag Officers is of blue cloth with a patent leather visor
and a band of gold embroidery, and it has an insignia on the front
consisting of a gold anchor with various decorations of leaves for the
different grades and corps.</p>

<p>The cap for officers below the rank of Rear Admiral is of the same
design, with narrow stripes of gold braid around the band to indicate
the rank of the wearer. On ordinary service aboard ship a cap of the
same design with a band of black silk ribbon is worn. The device worn
on the front of the cap by these officers is a gold foul anchor placed
vertical.</p>

<p>Warrant officers wear dress uniforms similar to those worn by
commissioned officers; their cap has one narrow gold stripe around
the band and a gold anchor on the front, and their sleeves have three
narrow stripes, the upper one of gold one-quarter of an inch wide, the
middle one a twisted silver rope one-eighth of an inch wide and the
lower one of gold of the same rope design.</p>

<p>The enlisted men of the French Navy wear uniforms of dark blue cloth
for cold weather and of white for hot weather, those for the chief
petty officers consisting of a plain cap with black leather visor, a
sack coat with gilt buttons and plain trousers, and those for enlisted
men of lower ratings consisting of a flat sailor cap, overshirt and
trousers of a design similar to those worn in the British Navy. A
prominent feature of their uniform cap is a red pompon in the center of
the top of the crown.</p>

<p>The overcoats are of dark blue cloth of the design commonly styled
“pea jackets.”</p>

<p>The rating or rank of the petty officers is indicated by distinguishing
marks worn upon the sleeves; some of the principal ones being:—

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Italian Army</span></h3>

<p>In the Italian Army the peace time dress uniforms consist, as a rule,
of a dark blue braided coat, light gray trousers with stripes of
distinctive corps color down the outer seams, and black leather boots
for officers and leggings for enlisted men. The head dress varies with
the corps and arm of the service, the infantry wearing a dark blue cap
trimmed with colored braid, the cavalry a metal trimmed helmet or a fur
busby, the field artillery a black shako with bright brass ornaments,
and the Bersaglieri a black felt hat with a plume of feathers falling
over the left shoulder.</p>

<p>The field service uniform is of gray cloth having a greenish tinge and
is practically the same for all arms of the service and for all corps,
except that the Bersaglieri wear their regular uniform of dark blue
with red facings and their distinctive head dress.</p>

<p>The officers’ field uniform consists of a short sack coat with a
standing-falling collar and a patch pocket on each breast; breeches or
trousers cut to fit the legs tightly below the knee, black boots or tan
leather shoes and leggings, and a straight crowned cap with sloping
visor of black leather and a band of distinctive corps color. The coat
is closed by buttons down the front concealed by a fly or by concealed
hooks and eyes. On each side of the collar at the front is a silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
star with a circular disc in the center upon which are the insignia
indicating the corps or arm of the service to which the
officer belongs.</p>

<p>The rank is indicated by the shoulder straps and the insignia worn upon
them. The shoulder knots for General officers are covered with silver
and bear gold stars to indicate the rank, those for Field officers
having a narrow edging of silver braid and silver stars to indicate the
rank, and those for company officers having only the silver stars to
indicate the rank; as follows:—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Belgian Army</span></h3>

<p>Before 1914 the uniforms of the Belgian Army for home service were
very elaborate and decorated with gold and silver braid and ornaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
although uniforms of cotton khaki were worn in hot weather on foreign
service; but the experience of the present war showed the necessity
of an inconspicuous dress for field service, and as a result the army
is now provided with a field uniform designed after the British Army
service uniform and made of dark khaki-colored woolen cloth.</p>

<p>The officers’ field service uniform consists of a coat similar to that
worn by British officers except that it has a standing collar; breeches
of the same material and color as the coat; a cap after the British
design, and tan leather boots, or tan leather shoes with khaki-colored
wrap puttees or tan leather strap puttees.</p>

<p>With this uniform the British “Sam Browne” tan leather belt and
shoulder strap is worn.</p>

<p>The corps or arm of the service to which an officer belongs is shown
by patches of colored cloth on the collar at each side of the neck
opening. The rank of officers is indicated by insignia upon these
collar patches, as follows:—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Russian Army</span></h3>

<p>The officers and enlisted men of the Russian Army formerly had a
great variety in uniforms for the different corps and branches of the
service; the infantry of the regular Line wore uniforms of green cloth
with red facings; the hussars wore green jackets trimmed across the
front with white stripes and loops, red breeches and black high boots;
the guards wore green uniforms with yellow facings; the Don Cossacks
wore uniforms of dark gray, the coat being long and the breeches very
loose and the headdress being a black shako; and the Kuban cossacks
wore a uniform of similar design of reddish brown cloth.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 an effort was made to
standardize the field service uniforms with the result that the present
service uniform is of cloth of a gray-brown shade. The Cossacks have to
some extent preserved their distinctive dress.</p>

<p>The service uniforms for officers consists of a single-breasted sack
coat with a standing collar, a pocket with flap on each breast and
closed by a row of gilt buttons down the front; breeches of the same
color with stripes down the outer leg seams of varying widths according
to rank and of different colors according to the corps or arm of the
service; a bell-crowned cap with sloping visor, and black boots.</p>

The rank is indicated by the trimming and ornamentation of flat
shoulder straps, those for the various grades of rank being shown in
the accompanying <a href="#RUSSIA_STRAPS">illustration</a>. It will be noted that
there are no grades of Brigadier General or Major in the Russian Army, but that
there are two grades of the rank of Captain, called First and Second or
Senior and Junior Captain. The duties of the Senior Captain correspond
in a measure to those of Major in the United States services. Line
officers of the rank of Colonel and below wear the number of their
regiment in the center of the shoulder strap.</p>

<p>The Russian officer’s service cap is similar to that worn by officers
of the United States Army except that the top of the crown is
relatively greater in diameter. The band is of the distinctive color of
the corps or arm of the service. A medallion made up of the national
colors is worn at the center of the band in front and the visor
and chin strap are of brown leather. In some of the regiments gray
sheepskin shakos are worn by both officers and men instead of the cap.</p>

<p>The arm of the service or corps is indicated by patches of colored
cloth on the front of the collar on each side of the neck opening.</p>

<p>The sword belt is of tan leather with a cross strap from the right
shoulder to the left side at the waist although in some corps the sword
is suspended from the diagonal cross strap only, the waist-belt not
being worn by officers.</p>

<p>The uniform of the enlisted men is of similar cut to that of the
officers except that the coats are looser and in some corps are closed
by a row of buttons down the right side.</p>

<p>The rank of the noncommissioned officers is indicated by stripes and
other insignia upon narrow flat shoulder straps worn from the base of
the collar to the top of the sleeve shoulder seam.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian Army has an officer of Warrant rank, intermediate between
the commissioned officers and enlisted noncommissioned officers. These
Warrant officers wear one broad stripe across the shoulder strap near
the collar end.</p>

<p>The noncommissioned officers wear narrow stripes on their shoulder
straps in the same position; a sergeant major having three such
stripes, a sergeant two and a corporal one.</p>

<p>There have been various corps and specialty insignia but as these are
now in a process of being changed they cannot be given accurately.</p>

<p>The Russian noncommissioned officers wear swords suspended from tan
leather belts and the privates wear a tan leather belt with cartridge
boxes of the same material. All of the enlisted men carry their extra
clothing in a blanket roll over the right shoulder and diagonally
across the body to the left side at the belt.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Russian Navy</span></h3>

<p>The uniforms of the officers and enlisted men differ in many respects
from those which are common to the navies of the other principal powers.</p>

<p>The officers’ uniforms are as a rule made of a dark green cloth for
dress and winter wear and of white cotton or linen for hot weather.</p>

<p>The prescribed uniforms are full dress, dress, undress and service
(working) dress.</p>

<p>The full dress uniform consists of a cocked hat, tunic with standing
collar, epaulets, and trousers with gold lace braid on the outer leg seams.</p>

<p>The dress uniform consists of a cap, double-breasted frock coat, with
epaulets, and plain trousers.</p>

The undress uniform is the same as the dress uniform without epaulets.</p>

<p>The service or working uniform consists of a cap, a short single
breasted tunic of dark blue cloth and plain trousers.</p>

<p>In hot weather a similar uniform of white cotton or linen material is worn.</p>

<p>An overcoat of black cloth and a heavier one of gray cloth with a fur
collar are worn by officers.</p>

<p>In May, 1917, the shoulder straps and the insignia of rank formerly
worn upon them were abolished and stripes on the sleeves above the cuff
to indicate rank with distinctive colors to indicate the Staff corps,
were adopted for all uniform coats and the overcoat.</p>

<p>These stripes for the different grades of rank are as shown by the
accompanying illustrations.</p>

<p>Officers of the Line and of the Engineer Corps wear gold stripes,
and officers of the Medical Corps, Naval Constructor Corps, Judge
Advocate’s Corps, and Paymasters wear silver stripes, with the stripes
edged with cloth of a distinctive color for each corps.</p>

<p>These distinctive colors are:</p>

<p>Paymasters wear silver stripes without the “curl” and without edgings
of colored cloth.</p>

<p>Officers wear a sword on all occasions of dress and ceremony, but on
occasions of ordinary duty they wear a short dirk in place of the sword.</p>

<p>The warrant officers of the Russian Navy wear uniforms similar to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
worn by commissioned officers, the distinguishing mark being a narrow
gold stripe around the sleeves above the cuff.</p>

<p>Enlisted men wear black cloth trousers, a jersey with blue and white
horizontal stripes and a blue jumper.</p>

<p>The caps are similar to those worn by enlisted men of the British Navy.</p>

<p>The name of the ship is given on the cap ribbon as in other navies,
this ribbon being tied at the back so that it hangs down in streamers.</p>

<p>White duck uniforms of the same pattern as the blue ones are worn in
hot weather.</p>

<p>The ratings of petty officers are indicated by badges worn on the
sleeves above the elbow; these badges are at present being revised and
hence cannot be accurately given.</p>

<p>All enlisted men are provided with short overcoats of gray cloth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Japanese Army</span></h3>

<p>Previous to the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5 the officers and enlisted
men of the Japanese Army wore uniforms of dark blue or red cloth with
facings of distinctive colors for the various arms, but this proved so
conspicuous on the battlefields of that war that a service uniform of
khaki-colored cloth for winter and khaki cotton drill for summer was
adopted. The officers, however, retained for their dress uniforms the
old dress uniforms of dark blue and red cloth with heavy decorations of
gold lace.</p>

<p>The dress uniform of the officers consists of a dark blue double
breasted frock coat with standing collar; trousers of dark blue cloth
with stripes of the corps color down the outer leg seams for all arms
except the cavalry in which the officers wear red breeches; black boots;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and a <i>kepi</i> style cap decorated with gold lace and having a red and
white standing plume at the front, this cap being of red cloth for the
cavalry and of blue cloth for the other arms.</p>

<p>The collar of the dress coat is covered with gold lace; the buttons
are gilt with a design of chrysanthemums and cherry blossoms; shoulder
knots of plaited gold cord and a sash belt of gold and red stripes
with heavy tassels at the left side are worn with it, and the rank is
indicated by sleeve decorations consisting of a knot made up of narrow
stripes of gold braid of the same design as that worn by officers of
the United States Army. This sleeve knot is made of one stripe for
Second Lieutenant and one additional stripe for each step up in grade
through the ranks of First Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant
Colonel, Colonel, Major General, Lieutenant General and Field Marshal,
the latter having a knot of nine stripes.</p>

<p>The distinctive colors for the different arms of the service are
red for infantry, green for cavalry, yellow for artillery, crimson
for pioneers, gray for the quartermaster corps, and black for the
gendarmerie (national police).</p>

<p>The service uniforms for both officers and enlisted men consist of a
single-breasted sack coat of khaki-colored woolen cloth for winter and
cotton drill for summer; trousers or breeches of the same materials,
and a bell-crowned cap with sloping visor of tan leather and a band of
the distinctive color of the arm of the service.</p>

<p>The service coat has a standing collar with a patch of the distinctive
color for the arm of the service on each side of the neck opening, a
pocket with buttoned flap on each side of the breast and a plain pocket
on each side below the waist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Officers wear breeches and boots when mounted and tan leather leggings
or khaki-colored wrap puttees for dismounted service. The shoes worn by both
officers and enlisted men with the service uniform are of tan leather.</p>

<p>The rank of the officers is indicated by shoulder straps worn
transversely across the shoulders next to the shoulder seams of the
sleeves, after the style of the shoulder strap worn by officers of the
United States Army with their blue dress coats. These are the only two
great armies in which this form of shoulder strap is worn by officers
to indicate rank.</p>

<p>These shoulder straps are covered with cloth of the distinctive color
of the arm of the service with stripes of gold braid running lengthwise
of them on the same scheme as that used on the shoulder straps worn by
Japanese naval officers as illustrated, namely, for General officers
one wide stripe, for field officers two narrow stripes and for company
officers one narrow stripe. On the gold stripes silver stars are worn
for the different grades of rank in each class. The number of stripes
and stars for each grade is as follows:</p>

The rank of noncommissioned officers is shown by narrow stripes around
the cuffs, and for all enlisted men the arm of the service is indicated
by the color patches on each side of the collar and the regimental
number is worn upon these collar patches, Arabic figures being used for
the regular service, Roman numerals for the militia and Arabic figures
on one side of the collar and Roman on the other for the reserves.</p>

<p>The overcoat for officers is a double-breasted ulster similar to that
worn by American officers, and that for enlisted men is single-breasted
and short. The overcoats are of khaki-colored cloth.</p>

<p>The service belts for both officers and men are of tan leather.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Japanese Navy</span></h3>

<p>When Japan began to build and man her modern navy she derived much
early training and experience from the British Navy, which was then as
now, the largest of the world’s navies.</p>

<p>As a result the uniforms of both the officers and men of the Japanese
Navy are similar in most respects to those of the British Navy. The
principal difference is that the Japanese naval officers’ undress or
service uniform coat is a single-breasted blouse with standing collar
similar to that worn by officers of the United States Navy, the collar
and edges being trimmed with black braid.</p>

<p>In the insignia of the Japanese Navy the cherry blossom usually takes
the place where the crown appears in the British naval insignia, as may
be seen by reference to the illustrations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The uniforms for both officers and enlisted men are of dark blue cloth
for full dress and dress uniforms, the undress or service uniform being
of dark blue cloth for winter wear and of white cotton duck or linen
for wear in hot weather.</p>

<p>The rank of officers is indicated by stripes around the sleeves above
the cuff on the blue uniforms and by shoulder straps on the white
service uniform.</p>

<p>The sleeve stripes are of gold lace braid for full dress and dress
coats and of black braid for the blue service coat.</p>

<p>The number, width and arrangement of the sleeve stripes for the

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Austrian Army</span></h3>

<p>The Army of Austria-Hungary is made up of so many different races
and peoples each of whom have preserved something of their original
national dress or uniform in their modern dress uniforms that the
varieties in color, design and ornamentation are greater than in any
other country.</p>

<p>The field service uniform of all however is nearly the same and is made
of light gray cloth.</p>

<p>The officers’ service uniform consists of a single-breasted sack coat
with a standing collar, closed by a row of buttons down the front
concealed beneath a flap and having shoulder straps, patch pockets with
button flaps, one on each breast and one on each side below the waist;
breeches of the same color as the coat; leather puttees and shoes; and
a cap of gray cloth, cylindrical in shape with a soft top to the crown
and side flaps which are folded up around the band and secured by two
buttons in front, and having a sloping visor covered with the gray
cloth of the cap. This cap, known as a tschapka, is a distinguishing
feature of the Austrian uniform.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>As variations of the field uniform the Hungarian regiments do not wear
leggings but have the trousers tight below the knees; the Alpine troops
wear heavy tan colored stockings instead of leggings and the Bosnia
troops wear a Turkish fez instead of the gray cap.</p>

<p>The rank of officers is indicated by insignia worn upon each side of
the collar. A Field Marshal has gold embroidery on the collar at each
side of the neck opening and two wide red stripes down the outer leg
seams of the trousers. General officers wear similar gold braid on the
collar with the grade of rank indicated by silver stars thereon as
follows:—</p>

<table class="space-above1 space-below2" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

      <td class="tdl_ws1">One silver star.</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>

<p>Field officers have gold or silver braid on the collar according to
whether their buttons are of silver or gold. On gold braid they wear
silver stars and on silver braid gold stars to indicate the grade of
rank, as follows:—</p>

The arm of the service is indicated by the color of the facings or
decorations on the uniform. The infantry have no regimental numbers
on their uniforms but a distinctive color for each group of four
regiments, each such group of the regular army having two Austrian and
two Hungarian regiments, the Austrian regiments wearing silver buttons
and the Hungarian regiments gilt buttons.</p>

<p>Chasseur regiments wear green facings or trimming and have the number
of the regiment on the buttons.</p>

<p>Dragoon regiments have distinguishing colors worn on the collars for
each two regiments, one regiment of each color wearing silver buttons
and the other gilt buttons.</p>

<p>Hussar and Uhlan regiments of cavalry have distinctive colors for each
two regiments as in the case of dragoon regiments but these colors are
also worn on the caps and the number of the regiment also appears on
the cap.</p>

<p>Artillery regiments have red facings and the buttons bear a gun
and a shell.</p>

<p>In the Austrian Reserves the infantry have green facings and trimmings
on their uniforms and the number of the regiment on the buttons and
shoulder straps, and the cavalry regiments have the regimental number
on the buttons only.</p>

<p>In the Hungarian Reserves the infantry regiments wear the regimental
number in dark gray cloth on the sides of the cap and the cavalry
regiments wear their number in yellow cloth on the cap.</p>

<p>The rank of noncommissioned officers is indicated by white stars of
celluloid worn on the distinctive color patches of the collar, as
follows:—

straps across one or both shoulders and the enlisted men wear belts and
cartridge boxes of tan leather. General and Staff officers wear the sword
slung from a belt beneath the coat and a sash of gold and black silk.</p>

<p>The overcoat for officers is a double-breasted ulster with gilt or

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
there are several distinctive features. The officers have no special
full dress coat with the cutaway skirts or swallow-tail effect, a frock
coat taking its place; and the enlisted men have in addition to the
ordinary sailor shirts with the wide falling collar a dress jacket
reaching to the waist line and roached over the hips like the jackets
of the American midshipmen. This jacket has a row of small buttons down
each side of the front and also on each cuff and is worn unbuttoned
with the falling collar of the shirt outside of it.</p>

<p>The commissioned officers have full dress, dress, blue service and
white service uniforms.</p>

<p>The full dress uniform consists of a cocked hat similar to that worn
by British naval officers; a long double-breasted frock coat; trousers
with gold lace stripes down the outer leg seams; black shoes; a sword
belt covered with silver and gold lace with a wide red stripe running
through it, and epaulets or shoulder knots depending upon the rank and
corps of the officer. A distinctive feature of this full dress frock
coat is that while it has a standing collar trimmed with gold lace, the
front is provided with wide triangular lapels covered with color facing
indicating the corps or branch of the service to which the wearer
belongs.</p>

<p>The dress uniform consists of a bell-crowned cap of dark blue cloth
with a braid of the distinctive corps around the band and a distinctive
insignia on the front; a frock coat like that of the British or
American naval officer; with which shoulder knots are worn; plain dark
blue trousers, and black shoes. With this uniform the same sword belt
is worn as with the full dress but instead of the sword a short sword
or dirk is worn. As a variation of this uniform the cocked hat is
sometimes worn with it for special occasions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>The blue service uniform consists of the blue cap; a double-breasted
square cut sack like that worn by British officers; plain dark blue
trousers, and black shoes. A plain black double-bow knot tie is worn
with this uniform.</p>

<p>The white service uniform consists of a white cap of the same design
as the blue cap but with a black band and black visor as in the United
States and British navies; a white single-breasted sack coat with
standing collar, a patch pocket on the left breast and a patch pocket
on each side below the waist; white trousers, and black or white
shoes depending upon the occasion. The dirk is worn with this uniform
suspended from a black leather belt worn beneath the coat. Shoulder
straps showing the rank are worn on the white service coat.</p>

<p>The overcoat is a long double-breasted coat cut to fit the figure,
buttoning to the neck, with a wide falling collar and an outside pocket
with flap on each side below the waist. It is closed by gilt buttons,
one row down each side.</p>

<p>Following the universal military custom, the rank of German naval
officers is indicated on the blue uniforms by stripes worn upon
the sleeves of the coat just above the cuff. The number, width and
arrangement of these stripes are shown in the accompanying
<a href="#GERMAN_SLEEVES">illustration</a>.</p>

<p>On the full dress coat sleeves there is a vertical three-pointed strap
on the outside over the rank stripes, its color being the distinctive
color for the corps to which the wearer belongs.</p>

<p>The rank is also indicated by insignia upon the tops of the epaulets
and shoulder knots. The tops of the epaulets are of the distinctive
colors of the corps except those for officers of the Line which are of
gold. The lower grade in each branch has no fringe of bullion on the epaulets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>The stripes indicating the rank of officers of the Line are sewn
directly upon the cloth of the coat sleeves and have a German Imperial
crown above the upper stripe. Officers of the Staff corps do not wear
the crown above their rank stripes. The corps or branch of the service
to which officers of the Staff corps belong is indicated by stripes of
colored cloth worn between the stripes indicating the rank, and the
distinctive colors are:—</p>

<p>The insignia worn upon the cap for commissioned officers is a gold
wreath surrounding a circular emblem made up of concentric circles of
red, white and black (from the center out) and surmounted by the German
Imperial crown. This medallion is also worn upon the center of the
front of the enlisted men’s flat caps.</p>

<p>These distinctive corps colors are also worn as the “facings” on the
full dress uniforms, that is on the lapels of the coat and on the
three-pointed straps on the cuffs, and around the band of the service
cap, blue and white, except that pilots wear a gold band on the cap.</p>

<p>Warrant officers in the German Navy wear a dress uniform and a
service uniform both blue and white similar in design to that worn
by commissioned officers, with their distinctive rank stripes on the
sleeves and on the shoulder straps.</p>

In the German Navy there is a rank intermediate between that of Warrant
officers and Chief Petty officers which has no counterpart in the
American Navy. This is called Feldwebel. His dress uniform is a blue
cap; a short dark blue jacket with rolling lapel collar and a row of
small gilt buttons down each side of the front; a blue waistcoat with
gilt buttons, and plain dark blue trousers; and his service uniforms,
both blue and white, are similar to those of other officers. On the
cuffs of the dress jacket he has three narrow gold stripes around the
sleeve close together and below them three similar stripes around the
sleeve and continuing down the outer seam to the bottom edge of the
sleeve, with a vertical strap of dark blue cloth across the stripes
with six small gilt buttons on it.</p>

<p>The Bandmaster is a Warrant officer and the distinctive mark of his
rank is a gold lyre on the center of his shoulder straps.</p>

<p>The uniforms of the enlisted men are the dress or “parade” uniform, the
service uniform and the white uniform.</p>

<p>The dress uniform consists of a sailor flat cap; a white sailor shirt
with wide dark blue falling collar; the dark blue dress jacket worn
with the collar of the shirt outside of it, and dark blue trousers, the
trousers being cut without the wide “spring” or flare at the bottom of
the legs so common in other navies.</p>

<p>The blue cap is similar to that worn in other navies but the crown is
higher in the front than in the back, which tends to give it a military
appearance. The name of the ship or station is worn upon a cap ribbon
around the band of the cap, the ends of the ribbon being tied at the
back and allowed to fall down the back in streamers. Upon the front of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
the crown at the center is the red, white and black medallion, the
colors of Germany.</p>

<p>The collar of the shirt has three rows of narrow white braid around the
edges as in the American and British navies.</p>

<p>The service uniform consists of the blue cap; a dark blue shirt similar
to that worn in the American Navy, and dark blue trousers.</p>

<p>The white service uniform is of the same design but of white duck
instead of dark blue cloth or flannel.</p>

<p>The rank or rating and the branch of specialty is indicated by
distinctive marks worn upon the left sleeve between the elbow and the
shoulder. Some of the principal of these marks are:—</p>

The overcoat worn by enlisted men of the German Navy is a short double
breasted pilot coat with turn-down lapel collar and a double row of
gilt service buttons down the front.</p>

<p>For service ashore in landing parties and when on duty at the coast
forts in hot weather or tropics, a khaki helmet is worn instead of the
white hat with white uniforms and khaki canvas leggings are also worn.
For landing parties as infantry or artillery black leather boots are
worn with the blue uniforms, the trousers being tucked inside of the boots.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of German Marines</span></h3>

<p>The German Marines are a part of the Navy and are divided into Marine
Infantry and Marine Field Artillery. They perform duties similar in
many respects to the duties of the United States Marine Corps.</p>

<p>The full dress uniform of the officers consists of a black shako with
a large red plume which falls over the front down to the visor; a blue
single-breasted tunic with standing collar; epaulets without bullion
fringes; breeches of the same color, and black boots. The front edges
of the coat and the tops and bottoms of the collar are piped with white
cloth and the cuffs are of white cloth with a vertical strap.</p>

<p>The service uniform is of gray cloth and consists of a bell-crowned cap
with a white band and sloping visor of black leather; a single-breasted
coat with a standing turn-over collar closed by buttons down the front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
concealed by a fly; breeches, and leggings and shoes of tan leather.
The coat has a pocket with flap on each side below the waist. Shoulder
straps are worn with the service coat.</p>

<p>The rank of the officer is indicated by insignia worn upon the epaulets
and shoulder straps, the insignia being the same as for the German Army
officers.</p>

<p>For hot weather a uniform of khaki cotton drill is provided, the
general style being the same as for the cloth service uniform except
that the head dress is a khaki-colored helmet.</p>

<p>The dress uniform of the enlisted men is similar in color and design
to that worn by the officers, the epaulets being replaced by shoulder
straps of white cloth. The service uniform of the enlisted men is of
the same design as that for officers except that the coat is closed by
a single row of gilt buttons and the cap has no visor.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the German Army</span></h3>

<p>The peace time uniforms of the various corps and arms of the German
Army present a great variety, the traditions of the services of the
former separate kingdoms and political divisions that are now united
to form the German Empire being preserved in many instances in the
color and design of the uniform or in the bright metal decorations and
insignia.</p>

<p>Many of these uniforms are gaudy in color and richly decorated with
gold, silver and colored cloth and braid ornaments.</p>

<p>The facings colors worn upon the collars and cuffs and as pipings on
the coats and trousers often vary with the individual regiments, and
the headdress is in many shapes and colors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>The Line Infantry wear a black helmet with brass spike, Prussian eagle
and scale chin strap; a blue single-breasted tunic with gilt buttons,
and dark gray trousers; the facings and piping being red, but the
infantry regiments of Saxony, Bavaria, Wurttemburg and some other
states have variations from this in both color and design.</p>

<p>The Uhlans wear the Czapka helmet; a blue double-breasted tunic with
a red plastron front and red facings; and dark gray trousers; the
Prussian Hussars wear a black fur busby with heavy gilt decorations
and a bag of the distinctive color of the facings, a single-breasted
blue tunic heavily decorated with white braid, loops and frogs; a blue
pelisse with white braid decorations slung from the left shoulder; dark
gray tight fitting breeches with white braid decorations, and black
Hessian boots with embroidered tops.</p>

<p>The Prussian Cuirassiers wear white uniforms with black hip boots and
cuirasses of brass or iron, the iron being black for some regiments and
bright for others.</p>

<p>The Saxon Jager regiments wear uniforms of green cloth and a cap with a
feather plume.</p>

<p>The Prussian Dragoon regiments wear helmets with drooping white plumes,
light blue jackets, dark gray breeches.</p>

<p>The Field Artillery regiments usually wear black helmets with a spike
ending in a brass ball; dark blue coats with gilt buttons, dark gray
breeches and black boots.</p>

<p>There are many other distinctive uniforms and the varied colors,
bright trappings and decorations and waving plumes made a peace time
assemblage of German troops of all arms a most imposing sight; but
early in the present century the leaders realized that while all this
gaudy panoply and pomp added to the attractiveness of the service, kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
alive the traditions of the past, and aided in holding the esprit de
corps, it would not do for service on the modern battlefield, where the
troops must be as inconspicuous as possible to avoid annihilation under
the drum fire of artillery and the rapid fire of machine guns.</p>

<p>As a result a field service uniform of a dull gray color was adopted
for all arms but it was not generally issued to the troops until just
before the opening of the present world war.</p>

<p>The German officer’s field service uniform consists of a gray single
breasted sack coat with a standing turn-over collar; breeches of the
same color and black or tan leather boots. With this uniform the
old bright helmets are worn with a gray cover to make them less
conspicuous, or in many cases a gray cap with sloping visor is worn.
The buttons are of gilt allowed to become dull in the field, in some
cases of leather or bone, and in other cases the coat is closed by
buttons concealed beneath a fly.</p>

<p>The corps and regimental colors are worn in small patches on the collar
at each side of the neck opening and also as cuff stripes in some corps.
In some corps the distinctive color is also worn around the cap band.</p>

<p>The rank of the German officer is indicated by the braid and insignia
on flat shoulder straps covered with braided cord. The shoulder strap
for Field Marshal and for General officers is covered with a plaited
knot made up of five loops of sets of three cords, the two outer
cords being gold and the central cord being silver interwoven with
the imperial colors in silk. The shoulder straps for Field officers
(Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels and Majors) are of the same design
except that the cords are in sets of two, both of silver interwoven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
with the silk colors. The shoulder straps of the company officers are
covered with parallel rows of silver cord interwoven with the silk colors.</p>

<p>The insignia of rank worn upon the shoulder straps on top of the cord
decorations are diamond shaped ornaments of gilt metal, and although
they do not have the conventional shape of a star they are called stars
in the German service.</p>

<p>These insignias are as follows for the various grades of rank:—</p>

<p>There is no corresponding rank in the armies of other nations for the
German rank of Colonel General, and in the German Army there is no rank
of Brigadier General.</p>

<p>In the German Army a Feldwebel is an officer between the commissioned
officers and the enlisted men, his rank corresponds to that of the
Warrant Officers in the United States Navy and Marine Corps. He wears
a double cord upon the shoulders and his rank insignia is a circular
medallion with a Prussian eagle on each side of the collar.</p>

<p>The German officer’s overcoat is a heavy ulster of the same gray color
as the field uniform; it is double-breasted and the rank of the wearer
is indicated by the shoulder straps as in the case of the service coat.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
The enlisted men of the German Army wear a service uniform of the same
color and general design as that of the officers. The ordinary field
cap is a round loose crowned cap without visor, the coat is a single
breasted sack with a standing turn-over collar, and the trousers are of
the same gray cloth as the coat. Boots of black or tan leather are worn.</p>

<p>Noncommissioned officers wear a stripe of braid around the cuff and
the front edges of the collar at the neck opening and for a short
distance along the top of the collar back from the neck opening. A
Sergeant Major wears a stripe of narrow braid above the noncommissioned
officer’s sleeve stripe.</p>

<p>The enlisted men’s overcoat is a heavy ulster buttoning to the neck
with a standing-falling collar, the rank of noncommissioned officers
being indicated by the sleeve braid as for the service coat and by
patches of color at the front of the collar.</p>

<p>Steel trench helmets are worn in the trenches by both officers and
men, this helmet being larger than that worn by the American, British
and French troops and having a flaring extension at the rear for the
protection of the neck.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Uniforms of the Roumanian Army</span></h3>

<p>The dress and service uniforms of the Roumanian Army are very similar
to those of the Austrian Army and the field uniform is of khaki-colored
cloth with the facings, pipings and rank insignia of the dress uniforms added.

<h3><span class="smcap">Foreign War Decorations and Medals</span></h3>

<p>The multiplicity of medals and decorations in all foreign countries
makes it very difficult to distinguish one from another, especially
since the designs and ribbons used by different countries are
frequently quite similar. To describe all of these decorations is not
practicable within the scope of this volume, but a few of the ones
which are classed as distinctively war decorations are included as they
are the ones most commonly seen and talked about.</p>

<p><i>French War Medals.</i>—The French decorations given for war service are
the <i>Legion d’honneur</i> (Legion of Honor), the <i>Medaille Militaire</i>
(Military Medal) and the <i>Croix de Guerre</i> (War Cross).</p>

<p>The Legion of Honor was inaugurated by Napoleon I at Les Invalides
on July 15, 1804, and the medals and ribbons were bestowed upon both
soldiers and civilians. The medal consists of a white star with five
double rays; the center of the star, surrounded by a wreath of oak and
laurel, bearing on the obverse the head of the Republic surrounded
by the words, “République Française, 1870,” and on the reverse two
tri-colored flags with the words, “Honneur et Patrie.” Above the star
is a small gold wreath and the ribbon is red.</p>

<p><i>The Medaille Militaire</i>, created by Prince Louis Napoleon in January,
1852, may be bestowed upon Generals and Admirals who have been
ministers of the state cabinet or commanders in chief, commanders of
Army Corps who have presided over the Superior Council of War and the
greatest of the war leaders of France. It is of silver, twenty-eight
millimeters in diameter, surmounted by a trophy of arms in silver and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
suspended by a yellow ribbon with green stripes at the edges. The
obverse of the medal bears the head of the Republic surrounded by the
words, “République Française, 1870,” and the reverse the words, “Valeur
et Discipline.”</p>

<p><i>The Croix de Guerre</i>, established by law on April 8, 1915, is awarded
to soldiers and sailors of all ranks in the service of France and her
Allies who perform individual acts of gallantry in operations against
the enemy during the present war and are mentioned for such acts in
official despatches. The cross is of Florentine bronze, four-armed
with two crossed swords between the arms, and is surcharged at the
center with a medallion bearing the head of the Republic surrounded by
the inscription “République Française” on the obverse and the dates
“1914-1915” on the reverse side. The ribbon is green with seven narrow
red stripes.</p>

<p><i>British War Medals.</i>—In Great Britain there are three orders which
may be bestowed upon officers by the King—the Order of the Bath, the
Order of St. Michael and St. George and the Distinguished Service
Order; five crosses or medals which may be awarded to officers or
enlisted men of the land forces—the Victoria Cross, the Military
Cross, the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the Military Medal and the
Meritorious Service Medal; and four crosses or medals which may
be bestowed upon officers and enlisted men of the sea forces—the
Victoria Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross (corresponding to the
Military Cross), the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (corresponding to
the Distinguished Conduct Medal), and the Distinguished Service Medal
(corresponding to the Military Medal).</p>

<p>Of all of these the one most highly prized by officers and enlisted
men alike both on sea and land is the Victoria Cross, which is awarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
individually to an officer or enlisted man of the Navy or Army for some
signal act of valor and devotion to his country in the presence of the
enemy and during action. Whenever it is possible to do so the V. C. is
presented in person by the sovereign.</p>

<p><i>The Victoria Cross.</i>—This decoration consists of a bronze cross
pattée with raised edges and it was instituted by Queen Victoria in
1856 during the Crimean War. On the obverse of the cross at the center
it is surcharged with a Royal crown surmounted by a lion passant
gardant and below the crown there is a semicircular scroll bearing
the words, “For Valour.” On the reverse side is engraved the date of
its bestowal. The cross is suspended from a ribbon by means of a bar
clasp ornamented with laurel leaves and a link in the shape of the
letter “V,” and the name, rank and regiment or ship of the recipient is
engraved on the reverse side of the clasp. The ribbon is red for the
Army and blue for the Navy.</p>

<p><i>The Distinguished Service Order.</i>—This order was established in 1886
to reward officers of the military and naval services for meritorious
or distinguished service in the field before the enemy. It is a gold
cross pattée convexed, enamelled white and edged with bright gold.
At the center on one side is a wreath of laurel enamelled in green
surrounding the Imperial crown enamelled in red, and on the other side
at the center a similar wreath surrounding the Royal cypher “G.R.” The
ribbon is red edged with blue.</p>

<p><i>The Distinguished Service Cross.</i>—This is a plain silver cross pattée
convexed. On the obverse at the center enclosed within a raised circle
is the Imperial cypher “G.R.I.” surmounted by the crown, while the
reverse side is plain. The ribbon is blue, white, blue.</p>

<i>The Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.</i>—The medal, established during the
Crimean War, is of silver, with the effigy of the reigning sovereign
on one side and a laurel wreath encircling the words, “For Conspicuous
Gallantry,” surmounted by a crown on the other side. It is awarded to
Warrant Officers, Midshipmen, Naval Cadets and Clerks in the Royal Navy
for conspicuous gallantry in the presence of the enemy. The ribbon is
blue, white, blue.</p>

<p><i>The Distinguished Service Medal.</i>—This medal was established October

noncommissioned officers and men of the Royal Marines for courageous
service in action during the present war. It is of silver and the
obverse bears the effigy of King George V., while the reverse bears a
wreath encircling the words, “For Distinguished Service,” surmounted by
a crown. The ribbon is blue with two narrow white stripes through the
center.</p>

<p><i>The Military Cross.</i>—This decoration was established in December,
1914, to reward captains, lieutenants and warrant officers of the Army
for deeds of valor or distinguished services in the present war. The
cross is of silver and each arm bears the Imperial crown while at the
center the Imperial cypher “G.R.I.” appears. The ribbon is white, blue,
white.</p>

<p><i>The Military Medal.</i>—This silver medal was authorized by the King
in March, 1916, to be awarded to officers and enlisted men of the
Army for conspicuous bravery in the field after recommendation by the
commanding general in the field. Its obverse bears the Royal effigy and
the reverse a wreath encircling the words, “For Bravery in the Field,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
surmounted by a crown. The ribbon is blue, white, blue, with two narrow
rod stripes through the central white stripe.</p>

<p><i>Belgian War Medals.</i>—The decorations and medals awarded in Belgium
for war service embrace the Order of Leopold, the <i>Croix Militaire</i>
(Military Cross), the <i>Medaille Militaire</i> (Military Medal), the <i>Ordre
de la Courenne</i> (Order of the Crown), the Order of Leopold II., the
Belgian War Cross and the Medal of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p><i>The Order of Leopold.</i>—This order was instituted by King Leopold
I. in 1832, to “reward services rendered to the country.” It is only
bestowed upon officers of high rank except in very exceptional cases.
It consists of a white enamelled Maltese cross resting upon a green
wreath of oak and laurel, surmounted by two crossed swords and a Royal
crown. On the obverse at the center is a gold lion rampant on a black
circular ground surrounded by the words, “L’Union fait la force.” The
color of the ribbon is Royal purple.</p>

<p><i>The Belgian War Cross.</i>—This cross is made of bronze and is modelled
after the French <i>Croix de Guerre</i>. It is bestowed upon officers
and men who are mentioned in General Orders for conspicuous acts of
gallantry in the field during the present war. It was established
October 25, 1915.</p>

<p><i>The Medal of Queen Elizabeth.</i>—This medal, founded by resolution of
September 9, 1916, is bestowed in the name of the Queen upon Belgians

<p><i>Italian War Medals.</i>—In Italy there are four Orders, the Order of
Annunziata, the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus, the Military
Order of Savoy, and the Order of the Crown of Italy; and a number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
military and naval medals, including the Sardinian Medal of the Crimea,
the Order of the Thousand of Garibaldi fame, the Medal Commemorating
the Unity of Italy, the Medal of the African Campaign, the Medal of the
Extreme Orient and the Messina Medal, the latter given to those who
distinguished themselves at the time of the Messina earthquake in 1908.</p>

<p><i>The Order of Savoy.</i>—This military order was founded by Victor
Emmanuel I. in 1815, to reward services in war on land and sea, and its
cross is highly prized. It consists of a white enamelled cross resting
upon an enamelled wreath and surmounted by a gold trophy of arms and
flags. At the center is a cross surrounded by the words, “Al Merito
Militare.” The ribbon is dark blue with a broad red stripe.</p>

<p><i>The Order of the Crown of Italy.</i>—This order was created in 1868
by Victor Emmanuel II. to reward Italians and foreigners who render
conspicuous services to Italy. The cross is of white enamel resting on
gold scrolls and bears at the center an iron crown. It is awarded to
officers of high rank for services in war.</p>

<p><i>The Medal for Military Valor.</i>—This medal of two classes, gold and
silver, corresponds to the French <i>Croix de Guerre</i>, and is awarded to
soldiers and sailors for conspicuous acts of gallantry in action in the
presence of the enemy. The gold medal is very rarely bestowed except as
an honor to the memory of a soldier or sailor who has lost his life in
the execution of the deed which the medal commemorates. The ribbon is blue.</p>

<p><i>Japanese War Medals.</i>—Japan has several orders, the first and best
known one being the Order of the Rising Sun, created in 1876. It is the
great national Japanese order and is divided into eight classes, being
awarded to officials, officers and rarely to civilians. In the military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and naval services the first six classes are awarded to officers and
the last two to enlisted men. The decoration consists of a medallion
enshrined <i>a cabochon garnet</i>, placed in the center of eight white
enamelled rays bezelled in gold and silver, and it is suspended from a
gold paulownia leaf. The ribbon is white with narrow red edges.</p>

<p><i>The Order of the Golden Kite.</i>—This order was founded by Emperor
Mutsuhito in 1891, to reward acts of especial bravery in battle on land
or sea. The decoration consists of a blue enamelled cross surrounded by

medals in bronze awarded to officers and men for participation in the
campaigns of the war with China and the war with Russia.</p>

<p><i>War Medals of Germany.</i>—Germany has many orders and medals but the
one best known as a war medal is the Iron Cross, founded in 1813, to
be given to both soldiers and civilians for services to the country.
It was revived in 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. The decoration
consists of a black iron cross pattée with a silver edge. At the center
is the letter “W”, on the upper arm a crown and on the lower arm the
date 1870 for the crosses awarded in that year and 1914 for those

size of the cross varying with the class. The ribbon is black with
white stripes near each edge for medals awarded to soldiers or sailors
and the reverse for those awarded to civilians. The Iron Cross has been
lavishly bestowed upon soldiers and sailors in the present war.</p>

<i>Austrian War Medals.</i>—Austria has many orders and decorations, the
Order of Francis Joseph being frequently conferred upon high officers
for conspicuous service in war. In addition there are distinguished
service medals of gold, silver and bronze, according to the importance
of the service rewarded, gold and silver medals for bravery in action,
and, for services in war alone, the War Decoration for officers and the
War Medal for enlisted men.</p>

<p><i>Turkish War Medals.</i>—Turkey has awarded many decorations and medals
upon her own soldiers and sailors as well as upon those of her allies
in different wars and upon citizens of other nations in peace time. The
best known of her orders are the Order of the Medjidie and the Order of
Osmanieh.</p>

<p><i>The Order of the Medjidie.</i>—The decoration of this order consists of
a seven-pointed star of cut silver, each point being composed of five
rays. Between the points there are seven small crescents and stars and

</div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF<br /> THE AMERICAN RED CROSS</span></h2></div>

<p>By the terms of the Geneva Convention held at Geneva, Switzerland, in
1864, all hospitals, hospital ships, surgeons, members of the hospital
corps, nurses, chaplains and all persons engaged exclusively with the
removal, transportation and treatment of the sick and wounded in war
are rendered neutral. The emblem used to mark hospitals and ambulances
is the white flag with the red Greek cross in the center as described
<a href="#Page_62">on page 62</a>.</p>

<p>Following this Convention Red Cross Societies were established in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
several countries, taking their name from the red cross on the hospital
flag. The movement has been extended throughout the world and to-day
every civilized country has its Red Cross Society, an International Red
Cross Committee at Geneva being the means of intercommunication between
the different national bodies.</p>

<p>The National Red Cross was founded at Washington, D. C., on October
1, 1881, incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia and
reincorporated April 17, 1893. Under the name of the American Red Cross
it was finally incorporated in 1905. The original founder was Miss
Clara Barton.</p>

<p>As at present constituted the American Red Cross is officered by a
President, Vice President, Treasurer, Counselor, Secretary-General,
General Manager, and Comptroller; the President being the President
of the United States. There is a Central Committee, consisting of
a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and one representative from each of the
Departments of State, Treasury, War, Navy and Justice, appointed by the
President; six members elected by the Board of Incorporators, and six
members elected by Delegates. There is an Executive Committee elected
by the Central Committee and a War Council of seven members appointed
by the President.</p>

<p>The War Council announces that the present work of the Red Cross should
contribute to the following aims:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. <i>To be ready to care for our soldiers and sailors</i> on duty
wherever and whenever that care may be needed.</p>

<p>2. <i>To shorten the War</i>—by strengthening the morale of the allied
peoples and their armies, by alleviating their sufferings in the period
which must elapse until the American army can become fully effective abroad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>To lay foundation for an enduring peace</i>—by extending a message
of practical relief and sympathy to the civilian population among
our Allies, carrying to them an expression of the finest side of the
American character.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-above1">The war work is divided into two main parts, the principal
purposes of which are summarized by the Council as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>The Work in the United States.</i>—</p>

<p>1. To take such measures as are necessary, in cooperation with the
Army and Navy, for the protection of the health and welfare of soldiers
in camps and cantonments, and of civilians whose welfare is involved in
war conditions.</p>

<p>2. To stimulate and guide the volunteer work of women in the
manufacture of supplies and comforts needed by troops and civilians
abroad and by men in training in this country.</p>

<p>3. To co-operate with the Government and with all relief agencies
in caring for the dependent families of men in the military and naval
service, and to relieve suffering caused by any disaster.</p>

<p>4. To maintain at the lowest cost consistent with efficiency,
machinery to assure the uninterrupted performance of these duties and
of the relief work in Europe.</p>

<p class="space-above2"><i>The Work in Europe.</i>—</p>

<p>1. To do everything possible to assist our Army and Navy in insuring
the health and comfort of American soldiers and sailors abroad.</p>

<p>2. To relieve suffering among the armies and destitution among the
needy civilian populations of our Allies.</p>

<p>The cooperation of the American Red Cross with the medical service
of the Army and Navy consists of recruiting, organizing and equipping
base hospital and other hospital and ambulance units to be called into
service when required by the Army or Navy Medical Corps; handling
special problems of health and sanitation in connection with the
cantonments, camps and naval stations; stimulating the manufacture of
surgical dressings and hospital supplies of all kinds; and promoting
the comfort and welfare of the men in training or en route from their
homes to camps and training stations.</p>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
When base hospitals and other organizations recruited, equipped and
trained by the Red Cross are taken over by the Army or Navy for active
service they become a part of such service and wear the uniform
thereof; but officials of the Red Cross assigned to duty with the
military establishments to perform such duties as are assigned to them
under the orders of the Secretary of War are required to wear the
regulation uniform and insignia of the American Red Cross as approved
by the War Department. Such officials have the status of officers
in the Army while so serving at the camps and stations and they are
accredited to the Division Commander and are subject to his authority
and to military laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF MEMBERS OF<br /> THE AMERICAN RED CROSS FIELD SERVICE</h3>

<p>The authorized uniform for the members of the American Red Cross Field
Service is made of cloth or serge of the same color as that used by the
U. S. Marine Corps for winter field uniforms, the shade being a grayish
olive green known as “forestry-green.”</p>

<p>For the officers, Division Directors of Military Relief and Assistants,
Field Directors of Camp Service, Assistant Field Directors of Camp
Service, Associate Field Directors, Hospital Service, Associate Field
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Directors, Home Service, and other Assistants, the uniform consists
of an overcoat, Norfolk jacket, riding breeches, flannel shirt, black
necktie, field hat or cap, grey gloves, and tan leather shoes and
leggings or tan leather field boots.</p>

<p><i>The coat</i> is a single-breasted, four-buttoned plain Norfolk jacket, of
forestry-green cloth, having a notch collar and soft lapels, the skirts
extending half way from the point of the hip to the bend of the knee,
with a two-inch belt of the same material as the jacket stitched around
the waist and a vent in the center of the back extending from the belt
to the lower edge of the skirt. The jacket has four outside patch
pockets with a two-inch box pleat down the center and a three-pointed
flap fastened at the center by a small button. On each shoulder there
is a strap of the same material as the jacket, let in at the top of the
sleeve seam and reaching to the edge of the collar where it is buttoned
with a small button, the dimensions of the strap being two inches in
width at the shoulder seam and one inch in width at the collar end,
the collar end being rounded. On each shoulder strap is worn a Greek
cross of red cloth or silk embroidery, the cross being three-quarters
of an inch over all and placed with its center one and one-eighth
inches above the shoulder seam. All of the buttons are plain flat green
buttons matching the color of the jacket. The initials A. R. C. in
plain block letters of bronze are worn on each side of the collar one
inch above the notch in the lapel. The various grades of officers are
shown by stripes of black mohair braid sewn around the lower part of
each sleeve of the jacket.</p>

<p><i>The breeches</i> are of forestry-green cloth cut loose in the thigh and
tight from the knee down, laced or buttoned below the knee with laces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
or buttons of the same color as the cloth of the breeches, with strappings
of the same material or of buckskin of a color to match on the inside of
the leg and knee.</p>

<p>The <i>cap</i> is of forestry-green cloth and of the same style and
dimensions as the regulation cap for officers of the U. S. Army, the
band covered with green mohair braid to match the color of the cap, the
visor and chin strap being of dark tan leather and the buttons of plain
bronze. A Greek cross of red enamel is worn on the center of the front
of the cap.</p>

<p>The <i>field hat</i> is the same as that worn by officers of the U. S. Army
and with it the officers of the American Red Cross wear a plain black
hat cord.</p>

<p>The <i>flannel shirt</i> is of the same design as that worn by officers of
the U. S. Army but the color is forestry-green. When the shirt is worn
without the jacket the initials A. R. C. in bronze block letters and a
small enamel red cross are worn on each side of the shirt collar, the
letters being in front. A light weight shirt of madras or cotton of the
same color and style as the flannel shirt may be worn.</p>

<p>The <i>overcoat</i> for officers is a double-breasted sack overcoat of knee
length made of forestry-green cloth. It has a turn-down notched collar
with soft lapels, two horizontal side pockets with straight flaps, and
shoulder straps similar to those on the jacket but slightly larger. On
each of these shoulder straps is worn a Greek cross of red cloth or
silk embroidery. The buttons of the overcoat are plain bone buttons of
a color to match the coat. On each side of the collar one inch above
the notch in the lapel the initials A. R. C. in plain bronze block
letters are worn. The various grades of officers are indicated by stripes
of black mohair braid around the sleeves as in the case of the jacket.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>The tan leather shoes, leggings and field boots are the same as those
prescribed for the officers of the U. S. Army.</p>

<p><i>Insignia of Rank.</i>—The grade or rank of the officers of the American
Red Cross is indicated by stripes of black mohair braid on the lower
part of the sleeves of the jacket, overcoat and field shirt. The
stripes on the sleeves of the overcoat and jacket are each one-quarter
of an inch wide, set one-half of an inch apart, extend entirely around
the sleeve and the lower stripe is two inches from the lower edge of
the cuff. The stripes on the sleeves of the field shirt are of the same
width and are set at the same distance apart but instead of encircling the
sleeve they are two inches long and sewn on the outer side of the sleeve.</p>

<p>The number of stripes for the different grades is as follows:—</p>

<h3>UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA FOR RED CROSS WOMEN WORKERS<br /> IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<p>The American Red Cross has authorized the wearing of distinctive
uniforms by the women workers engaged in the various Red Cross Chapter
activities, other than nursing and hospital service, in order that
these workers may be readily recognized as such throughout the United
States and also for protective and hygienic reasons. The wearing of
these uniforms is optional on the part of any member entitled to wear
them, but as the right to wear them carries with it the assumption of
responsibility for the organization both efficiency and <i>esprit de
corps</i> should be greatly aided by the use of the uniforms.</p>

<p>Permission to wear these uniforms is granted by the executive committee
of each Red Cross Chapter. No person under eighteen years of age is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
granted permission to wear the Workroom uniform, in the Motor and
Clerical service the minimum age is twenty-one years and in the Canteen
service it is twenty-three years. Everyone before being granted a
permit to wear any of the official Red Cross uniforms is required to
take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF UNIFORMS</h3>

<p>Elaborate uniforms have been avoided and as far as possible variety has
been eliminated. To distinguish the different corps of workers an apron
and a “coif” or headdress of different colors have been prescribed. For
workrooms the apron is white, for the canteen service it is blue, and
for the clerical service grey, all being of the same pattern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Workroom Uniform.</span>—For all workers on surgical dressings,
garments and knitted articles. If it is found desirable to distinguish
the workers in different workrooms, a white arm band or a sash marked
in blue letters “Garments,” “Surgical Dressings,” “Knitting” or
“Comforts” may be worn.</p>

<p><i>Apron.</i>—A large white apron fastening in the back, with sleeves to
the wrist and a V or square neck. The belt is three inches wide and
there are two pockets in the skirt. A red cross, two inches square, may
be worn in front at the center of the base of the neck.</p>

<p><i>Coif.</i>—A veil of batiste or similar material, cut one yard long and
one yard wide, with a lower hem one inch broad and a hem at the top two
inches broad and turned back on the outside. The color of the veil is
red, white or dark blue. A band of some stiffer material extends around
the head one-half inch from the front hem and a red cross is worn in
the center of the forehead band.</p>

<i>Instructors on active duty</i> in workrooms wear either a red veil or a
white veil with red band; <i>heads of workrooms</i> wear either a blue veil
or a white veil with dark blue band, and all other workers wear a white
veil with white band. They all wear the customary white apron and red crosses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motor Service Uniform.</span>—For workers in the Motor Service
the uniform consists of a long gray double-breasted coat of whipcord or
Oxford cloth, with falling collar and notched lapels, an inverted box
pleat in the back, a belt of the same material and flat buttons to
match; a close fitting hat of the same material as the coat with a
small red cross in the front; a short skirt of the same material as the
coat; tan leather leggings and tan leather shoes. The insignia of the
service is worn on the sleeve of the coat between the elbow and the
cuff. It consists of a white square bearing a motor wheel with a red
cross at the center.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canteen Service Uniform.</span>—The indoor uniform consists of an
apron of the same style as the workroom apron, of horizon blue color,
with a two-inch red cross at the base of the neck; white collar, white
cuffs bearing a special insignia for these workers, and a veil of
horizon blue bearing the same insignia on the front of the head band.
This special insignia for the Canteen Workers is a woven white shield
with a red cross at the center surrounded by the lettering “<span class="smcap">A.
R. C. Canteen Worker</span>.” The shield on the head band is two and
one-quarter inches in size and that for the cuff one and one-half inches.</p>

<p>For outdoor work in winter the Canteen Service is provided with a gray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
whipcord overcoat and a close fitting gray cloth cap of the Royal
Flying Corps type, the prescribed insignia being worn on the cuffs of
the coat and on the front of the cap, as shown in the <a href="#CANTEEN_OUTDOOR">illustration</a>.
In summer a plain dark blue or black sailor hat with the insignia on the
front of the band is worn either with or without the veil.</p>

<p>The special insignia for the Canteen Workers is necessary at all times
in order that the wearers may be quickly recognized by commanders of
troop trains and camp organizations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bureau of Information and Clerical Service Uniform.</span>—This
uniform consists of an apron of the same pattern as that for the
workroom uniform of gray material and a gray veil. White collar and
cuffs and the red cross on the apron and veil are worn with this
uniform as shown by the <a href="#INFO_BUREAU">illustration</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uniforms for Ushers and Others.</span>—Ushers and other active
personnel of the Red Cross, such as those engaged in membership
campaigns, are allowed to wear a white badge on which is a red cross or
they may wear a white sash with a red cross on the front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurses’ Uniforms.</span>—The uniforms for female nurses in the Red
Cross hospitals are similar to those worn by such nurses in the Army
and Navy, but the nurses in the base hospitals and other military
hospitals in France are required to wear uniforms of gray material.</p>

THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION</span></h2></div>

<p>The War Work department of the Young Men’s Christian Association has
established branches at the principal U. S. Army and Navy camps and
stations at home and abroad for the benefit of the enlisted men. At
these stations everything practicable is done for the comfort and
entertainment of the soldiers, sailors and marines who may be in the
vicinity; lectures, music and moving pictures are provided, books,
magazines and papers are furnished and facilities for writing letters
are supplied.</p>

<p>These Y. M. C. A. stations, or “huts” as they are frequently styled,
are conducted by war workers detailed by the Association. In order that
these war workers may be readily recognized at all times by officers
and enlisted men a distinctive uniform has been authorized for them.</p>

<p>This uniform is made of forestry-green cloth and consists of a sack
coat, breeches, tan leather shoes, tan leather leggings, cap or field
hat, flannel shirt, four-in-hand tie, and an overcoat.</p>

<p><i>The coat</i> is single-breasted, with a rolling collar and notched
lapels, closed down the front by a single row of bronze buttons, shaped
to the figure, the skirt extending to about ten inches below the waist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
On each shoulder there is a shoulder strap sewn into the sleeve
shoulder seam and attached at the collar end by a small bronze button.
On each breast there is a patch pocket and on each side below the waist
a patch pocket of the bellows type, each pocket being closed at the top
by a shield shaped flap secured by a small bronze button. Around the
waist is sewn a belt of the same material as the coat. The insignia of
the Y. M. C. A. are worn upon the cuffs.</p>

<p><i>The breeches</i> are of the same material as the coat and of the same
style as those prescribed for officers of the U. S. Army.</p>

<p><i>The cap</i> is of the same style and dimensions as that prescribed for
officers of the U. S. Army, and is made of forestry-green cloth with a
black mohair band, and visor and chin strap of black patent leather.
The insignia of the Y. M. C. A. are worn at the center of the front of
the cap.</p>

<p><i>The field hat</i> is of the U. S. Army regulation pattern and color with
hat cord of red and blue braided strands.</p>

<p><i>The overcoat</i> is a double-breasted ulster of forestry-green cloth,
with two rows of bronze buttons down the front, buttons to the throat
and has a stand and fall collar of the same style as the U. S. Army
regulation overcoat. On the back at the waist line there are two straps
of the same material as the coat let into the side seams and secured
together by two bronze buttons. On each side below the waist there is
a pocket with a horizontal opening covered by a rectangular flap. The
skirts of the overcoat extend to about ten inches below the knee when
the wearer is standing. The Y. M. C. A. insignia are worn upon the cuffs.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class="h_subtitle">CUSTOMS OF THE SERVICES</span></h2></div>

<p>The rules which govern official and social intercourse among members
of the military and naval services are based upon the well established
customs which prevail in all walks of life, modified only to such
extent as may be required by the peculiar conditions of the services in
order to secure the greatest degree of efficiency and discipline.</p>

<p>In a military sense discipline may be defined as the cheerful,
unquestioned and implicit obedience to the orders from higher authority
in such manner as to secure systematic action and the cooperation of
all of the component parts of a military force whatever its size may
be. This requires a close acquaintance between officers and men, a
mutual respect and confidence between them, and combined with this the
long hours of drill that tend to make obedience second nature and that
harden all physically and bring the whole machine to that high state of
discipline and training that may be termed “the fighting edge.”</p>

<p>To secure the desired end requires such a degree of mutual respect
among all of the personnel that there will never be the slightest
lack of confidence nor hesitation in complying with an order. To many
civilians the military hand salute appears unnecessary and it has even
been proposed in some quarters to abolish such salutes by enactment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
law on the ground that they are not in accord with the spirit of
American institutions. Yet the soldier knows that the salute is but the
outward and visible sign of discipline, that it denotes smartness and
<i>esprit</i>, that it is the patent evidence of alertness and cohesion and
the very antithesis of slouchiness and disaffection.</p>

<p>The regulations of the services are insistent that discipline shall be
enforced with firmness and decision but at the same time with constant
consideration of the rights and feelings of others, whatever their rank
or station may be. Courtesy and politeness are demanded at all times
in the services of the United States and no enforcement of authority
through the “rule of fear” is tolerated.</p>

<p>Strict attention to personal bearing and appearance is an index of
character no less in the military services than in other walks of life,
as the soldier who is not neat and clean when it is possible for him
to be so can rarely be depended upon in a pinch. The best soldiers and
sailors get their “clean shave” every morning when soap and water are
obtainable whether in the security of peace or the stress of wartime.
As one fine soldier expressed it, “We try to live clean, fight clean,
and if need be we’ll die clean.”</p>

<p><i>Salutes.</i>—On shore salutes are exchanged between officers and between
officers and enlisted men not in military formation, nor at drill,
work, games or mess, on every occasion of their meeting, passing near
or being addressed, the officer who is junior in rank or the enlisted
man always saluting first and the senior always promptly returning the
salute.</p>

<p>Upon the entry of an officer into a room where there are several
enlisted men some one of them who sees him calls “Attention,” whereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
all rise and stand at attention until the officer leaves the room or
orders otherwise. If at meals enlisted men stop eating and remain
seated and quiet. Officers and enlisted men if seated, rise upon the
approach of a senior officer, face toward him and salute, and if
standing they face toward the senior and salute. Soldiers do not stop
work upon the approach of an officer unless addressed by the officer.
Before addressing an officer an enlisted man salutes and also salutes
again after receiving the reply of the officer.</p>

<p>No salutes are rendered by men on guard duty over prisoners if it will
interfere with the execution of their duty.</p>

<p>Officers or enlisted men passing the uncased colors always salute.</p>

<p>No salutes are rendered when troops are marching in double time or at
the trot or gallop when mounted.</p>

<p>When an officer or enlisted man is mounted and has a communication to
make to a senior who is dismounted the junior dismounts before saluting
and delivering his message, except during field maneuvers or campaigns
where time might be lost in doing so.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in all cases both the junior and the senior
salute, but that military courtesy requires the junior to salute first.</p>

<p>No salutes are exchanged between enlisted men but it is customary for
enlisted men to stand at attention when addressed officially by other
enlisted men who are their seniors in rank.</p>

<p>If an enlisted man is in a military formation and is personally
addressed by an officer he does not salute, but if not already standing
at attention he comes to that position at once.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance within which salutes are rendered, known as “saluting
distance,” is taken to be that within which the uniform and insignia
of an officer is readily distinguishable, normally about thirty paces,
one pace being thirty inches, and salutes are generally exchanged at a
distance of about six feet.</p>

<p>In railway trains, street cars, theaters and public buildings where
salutes would be manifestly inappropriate or where the observance of
the rules regarding saluting would be apt to interfere with civilians
present salutes are usually not rendered.</p>

<p>Officers and enlisted men in civilian clothing exchange salutes in the
same manner as if wearing uniform, but no officer in civilian clothes
is saluted with cannon or has a guard of honor turned out and paraded
in his honor.</p>

<p>The same salutes are given by all officers and enlisted men of the
military and naval forces to officers of foreign armies and navies.</p>

<p>On board ships of the Navy officers and enlisted men while on board
their own ship salute their captain on every occasion of meeting,
passing near or being addressed by him. They salute all officers who
are their senior in rank on the occasion of their first daily meeting
or passing near and upon being addressed by the senior officer, and at
other times during the day they stand at attention instead of saluting.
Officers from other ships are saluted on each occasion of meeting or
passing near.</p>

<p>When in uniform officers and enlisted men should salute ladies with the
military hand salute and the headdress should not be removed for this
purpose when out of doors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-below2">The Navy Regulations require that all boats
from men-of-war shall exchange salutes when passing each other in
accordance with the following table, which covers all of the various
conditions likely to arise.</p>

<p>The starboard gangway ladder is used habitually by officers and their
visitors when going on board of a man-of-war or departing therefrom,
and the port gangway is used by all other persons. In other words the
starboard gangway may be considered the “front door” of a ship. Yet
whenever circumstances render it advisable or necessary an exception
may be made to this rule by the commanding officer’s order.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon reaching the quarterdeck from a boat, from a gangway or from
the shore, or from any other part of the ship, officers and men face
the colors, stand at attention and salute the colors; and the same
procedure is followed upon leaving the quarterdeck.</p>

<p>After saluting the colors upon arriving on the quarterdeck and just
before saluting the colors upon leaving the quarterdeck, officers and
enlisted men salute the officer of the deck, and the officer of the
deck returns both the salute to the colors and the salute to him.</p>

<p>Officers coming on board usually, after saluting the officer of the
deck, say, “I request permission to come aboard, sir,” and briefly
state their business; and after saluting the officer of the deck upon
leaving the ship they say, “I request permission to leave the ship,
sir.” The same procedure should be followed by civilians visiting a
ship except that no salutes to the officer of the deck are required.</p>

<p>Strict observance of military custom demands that an officer in uniform
and under arms, that is carrying the weapon with which he is armed or
wearing his belt and sword, should not remove his headdress either out
of doors or within doors; but in deference to the universal custom
among civilians it is considered proper for officers in uniform and
wearing their swords sheathed to remove their headdress when entering
a room, especially in case there are ladies present. Under such
circumstances the headdress is carried under the left arm, leaving the
right hand free to shake hands. With the sword drawn and in hand the
headdress should not be removed from the head.</p>

<p>The pedantic observance of so-called military customs is both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
unnecessary and objectionable, and the safest course is follow the
rules of deportment which distinguish the gentleman the world over.</p>

<p>Following the universal custom the right side is considered the
position of honor and hence when two or more officers are walking or
riding in company the senior walks or rides on the right, and likewise
the senior occupies the seat at the right side in a carriage or other
conveyance.</p>

<p><i>Visits and Courtesies.</i>—An officer arriving at the headquarters of
a military command calls upon the commander as soon as practicable
and registers his name, address and probable length of stay. If the
visiting officer is senior in rank to the commander he may send his
card and address, in which case it becomes the duty of the commander
to make the first call. When an Army officer arrives at Washington, D.
C., he reports at the office of the Adjutant General of the Army, and
registers his name, local address and business in Washington. Naval
officers under similar circumstances register at the Navy Department
and Marine officers at the Headquarters of the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>After reporting for duty at a station on shore or aboard ship an
officer makes a social call upon the commanding officer who returns
the call promptly. In the case of other officers at the post it is
the custom for all of those already at the station to call upon the
late arrival, thus following the American and not the European custom
in this respect. In addition to the social call upon the commanding
officer the arriving officer also makes a call upon any officer at
the station or on board of the ship who is senior to the commanding
officer, as in the case of a general officer at an Army station or a
flag officer on board of a ship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of the arrival of a ship in a foreign port calls are
interchanged according to well established international rules between
the senior officer of the ship or ships arriving and those already
stationed at the port. The general rule is that if the two officers are
of the same grade the latest arrival makes the first call, but if they
are of different grades the junior makes the first call. The arriving
officer, however, always makes the first call upon the highest civil
official ashore at a foreign port.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of a United States fleet, squadron or single ship at a
foreign port, the senior naval officer exchanges calls with diplomatic
and consular officers who may be stationed there according to the
following rules:—</p>

<p>A flag officer or commodore pays the first visit to diplomatic officers
of or above the rank of <i>chargé d’affaires</i> and receives the first
visit from consular officers.</p>

<p>A commanding officer pays the first visit to diplomatic officers of
or above the rank of <i>chargé d’affaires</i> and to a consul general and
receives the first visit from all other consular officers.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that all of these rules and conventions are
devised for the purpose of avoiding friction or misunderstanding and to
secure efficiency and smoothness in the official and social relations
between officers and officials of different services and nationalities.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br /><span class="h_subtitle">HONORS AND DISTINCTIONS</span></h2></div>

<p>The honors and distinctions shown to the National Flag, to the
President and other high Government officials, to the National Anthem
and to the officers of the various ranks in the different services
composing the Armed Forces of the United States are prescribed in the
U. S. Army Regulations and the U. S. Navy Regulations, which are issued
by the Secretaries of War and the Navy by authority of the President of
the United States.</p>

<p>At Army Posts and Stations the National Flag is hoisted at sunrise and
lowered at sunset and on board ships of the Navy the National Flag is
hoisted at 8 a. m. and lowered at sunset, these occasions being known
as “Morning Colors” and “Evening Colors.”</p>

<p>While the National Flag is being hoisted and lowered all officers and
enlisted men stand at attention facing the flag, if in uniform and
covered they stand at the salute during the hoisting or lowering of
the flag and if in civilian dress covered, they uncover and hold the
headdress opposite the left shoulder. The latter form of salute is the
correct one for all civilians who desire to so honor the flag of their
country.</p>

<p>When passing the National Flag flown at an Army post or on board a
ship of the Navy, the flag is saluted with the “right hand salute” or
if arms are carried in hand, with the prescribed salute for the arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
carried. The same honor is accorded to the flag when it is carried past
by any organization of the military or naval forces. The same honor
is accorded by members of the military and naval forces of the United
States to the flags of other nations under like circumstances.</p>

<p>When a band is present at morning or evening colors the National Anthem
is played during the hoisting and lowering of the colors, and when
ships of the navies of other nations are in the same port the national
anthem of those nations is also played by the bands of ships of the
United States Navy.</p>

<p><i>The National Anthem</i> of the United States of America is the
composition consisting of the words and music known as “The Star
Spangled Banner,” which was officially designated as such by the
President of the United States on August 23, 1916.</p>

<p>For many years of its existence as a nation the United States of
America had no officially recognized national anthem although various
national songs and airs attained widespread popularity. During the
Revolution “Yankee Doodle” and “The World Turned Upside Down” were
popular military airs and the former still survives to some extent as a
national song.</p>

<p>In 1832 the Reverend Samuel Francis Smith, a Baptist minister of
Boston, wrote the song entitled “My Country, ’Tis of Thee” and it was
set to the music of the British National Anthem, “God Save the King,”
and widely published in prayer books as the American National Hymn.
This has led many people to believe that it was the official National
anthem; however this is not the case, as it never received any official
recognition as such.</p>

<p>During the Civil War, 1861 to 1865, there were a number of airs that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
reached great popularity among the soldiers and sailors of both sides,
the most stirring of these airs being “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”
in the North and “Dixie” in the South.</p>

<p>The Navy Regulations of 1890 prescribed that “The Star Spangled Banner”
should be played by the bands at morning colors and “Hail, Columbia” at
evening colors, thus giving an official standing to both airs.</p>

<p>In the Navy Regulations of 1893 and the Army Regulations of 1895 “The
Star Spangled Banner” was prescribed for use at colors and came to
be officially recognized as the National Air, but it was not until
the President’s order of August 23, 1916, that it became the official
National Anthem.</p>

<p>By the order of the President the honors shown to the National Anthem
are prescribed in the U. S. Army Regulations as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Whenever the National Anthem is played at any place when persons
belonging to the military services are present, all officers and
enlisted men not in formation shall stand at attention facing toward
the music (except at retreat, when they shall face toward the flag). If
in uniform, covered, they shall salute at the first note of the anthem,
retaining the position of salute until the last note of the anthem. If
not in uniform and covered, they shall uncover at the first note of the
anthem, holding the headdress opposite the left shoulder and so remain
until its close, except that in inclement weather the headdress may be
held slightly raised.</p>

<p>The same rules apply when “To the Color” or “To the Standard” is
sounded as when the National Anthem is played.</p>

<p>When played by an Army band, the National Anthem shall be played
through without repetition of any part not required to be repeated to
make it complete.</p>

<p>The same marks of respect prescribed for observance during the
playing of the National Anthem of the United States shall be shown
toward the National Anthem of any other country when played upon
official occasions.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
The U. S. Navy Regulations prescribe the same honors whenever the
National Anthem is played on board a vessel of the Navy, at a Naval
Station or at any place where persons belonging to the naval service
are present.</p>

<p>Civilians wishing to pay the proper honor to the National Anthem should
stand at attention whenever present at any place where the National
Anthem is played and if covered they should remove the headdress and
hold it opposite the left shoulder while standing at attention during
the playing of the music.</p>

<p>When the President of the United States visits a Fort or Station of the
United States Army he is received with the command formed in line under
arms, the national colors and regimental standards being carried by the
troops, officers and men saluting with the “Present arms,” the band
playing the National Anthem followed by four ruffles of the drums and
four flourishes of the bugles.</p>

<p>An ex-President and Vice President of the United States are received
with the same honors except that the band plays a march instead of the
National Anthem.</p>

<p>The President of a foreign republic or the sovereign or a member of the
royal family of a foreign country is received with the same honors as
the President of the United States except that the National Anthem of
his country will be played by the band.</p>

<p>Members of the President’s Cabinet, the Chief Justice, the President
pro tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
American and foreign Ambassadors and Governors (within their respective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
states or territories) are received with the same honors as the Vice
President except that the number of ruffles and flourishes is three.</p>

<p>General Officers of the Army or Marine Corps and Flag Officers of the
Navy are received with the national colors and regimental standards,
officers and men saluting with the “Present arms,” the band playing a
march followed by ruffles and flourishes of the drums and bugles, the
number of ruffles and flourishes depending upon the rank of the officer
being received, as follows:</p>

<p>General or Admiral—four ruffles and flourishes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General or Vice Admiral—three ruffles and flourishes.</p>

<p>Major General or Rear Admiral—two ruffles and flourishes.</p>

<p>Brigadier General or Commodore—one ruffle and flourish.</p>

<p>In addition to the above honors salutes with cannon are fired upon the
arrival and departure of the President of the United States and the
president or sovereign or a member of the royal family of a foreign
country; and upon the arrival of other officials and military and naval
officers in accordance with their rank as follows:</p>

<p>Officers of foreign armies and navies are received with the same honors
as those tendered to officers of like rank in our own services.</p>

<p>At every Army post provided with suitable artillery a cannon salute
of twenty-one guns, known as a “National salute,” is fired at noon on
Washington’s Birthday, February 22nd, and on Memorial Day, May 30th,
and on Independence Day, July 4th, a salute of one gun for each state
in the Union is fired.</p>

<p>The honors and ceremonies to be observed when the President of the
United States or the president or sovereign of another country, or a
lesser official entitled to such honor visits a ship of the U. S. Navy
are given in the following table from the U. S. Navy Regulations.</p>

<p>These honors are decided by international custom and are practically
the same in all of the navies of the world and a strict observance
of them is necessary to avoid any occasion for international
misunderstanding that might arise from an omission of any customary
honor or salute.</p>

<p>In addition to the gun salutes described in the above table a National
salute, twenty-one guns, is fired by every ship in the Navy at noon on
Independence Day, July 4th, Washington’s Birthday, February 22nd, and
Memorial Day, May 30th.

When a ship of the Navy is in a port of a foreign country upon the
National holiday of that country a salute of twenty-one guns is fired
at noon on that day.</p>

<p>In accordance with established military courtesy salutes are exchanged
between officers and between officers and enlisted men not in a
military formation, nor at drills, at work, engaged in playing athletic
games or at meals, on every occasion of their meeting or passing or
being addressed by a senior, the officer who is junior in rank or the
enlisted man saluting first, and the officer senior in rank returning
the salute.</p>

<p>When the officer or enlisted man is not bearing arms of any kind in his
hands he salutes with the right hand by bringing the hand smartly up to
the visor of the cap above the right eye, fingers closed, hand, wrist
and forearm straight, palm of the hand to the left and right forearm at
an angle of forty-five degrees, and then dropping the arms to the side.</p>

<p>The distance within which salutes are required is that within which
recognition is easy, usually considered to be about thirty paces
(twenty-five yards).</p>

<p>When troops of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are reviewed by the
President of the United States or by any official or officer entitled
to review them, they march past the reviewing officer with the bands
playing a suitable march, the colors and standards saluting, officers
and enlisted men rendering the marching salute and the drummers and
buglers sounding the ruffles and flourishes appropriate to the rank of
the reviewing officer.</p>

<p>The salute with the colors and standards is made by drooping them to
the front. The marching salute for officers and enlisted men is made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
turning the head and eyes toward the person to be saluted and is known
as “eyes right” or “eyes left,” depending upon whether the position
of the reviewing officer is to the right or left of the column as it
passes in review, officers also salute with the sword by bringing it up
and to the front until the hand grasping the hilt is opposite the chin
and then sweeping the hand and sword down and to the right.</p>

<p>Many of the regiments of the Army have distinctive marches which are
played when passing in review but no distinctive march has ever been
adopted for the Army as a whole.</p>

<p>The march usually played by the bands of the sailor regiments of the
Navy when passing in review is “A Life on the Ocean Wave,” and that
played by the bands of the Marine Corps under the same circumstances is
“Semper Fidelis,” the title of the march being the motto of the Marine Corps.</p>
